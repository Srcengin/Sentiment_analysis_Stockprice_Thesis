I’m just waiting to get my 50 bucks back and then I think I’ll get out. Of course they keep saying it’s going to be profitable by the end of 2023 and if it’s anything like Tesla it should shoot up to $100-$200 at that point and then after that the sky is the limit. 

Tesla went from 200 to 2500 the first year it became profitable. Of course NIO is not Tesla but I don’t think the Chinese government will let them fail.

596F0_EOiks,@raymondwong2521,2022-03-11T19:52:41Z,"I was in Tesla, NIO, xpeng, Nikola.  I bought Tesla at $55 (or $11 split-adjusted) sold at $6,000 (or $1,200 split-adjusted).  I bought NIO at $4-$16, sold off at $48ish, I bought Xpeng at $17, sold off at $55-65, I bought Nikola at $12-18, sold off at $75-92.  Note that my selling prices never were among the highest points of stock prices of these companies, nor have I ever been able to buy these shares at the lowest price points possible.  However, i have made tons of green with my strategy.  You have to monitor the market sentiment.  If you fail to monitor what the markets are likely to do in the next 12 months, you are doomed.  For now, the next 12 months is more a wash to me.  Not a definite up nor down trend.  I only feel there will likely be lots of ups and downs i.e. volatility.  However, Federal Reserve Bank's meeting on March 14-15 will give us some clarity.  If they decide to not increase rates  at as fast as the speed they have previously mentioned, stocks could go crazy up in the short term.  By the way, I have been shorting Rivian since $103 a share.  I am still having my short position with Rivian.  That is a company that is only worth no more than $5 billion market cap and I think I am already quite generous to give Rivian a 5 billion usd market cap even when it is failing with its production ramp.   Back to NIO, I think NIO will have some chances of hitting $10.  Will it go below?  That will largely depend on how SEC will frame its mentality towards delisting the rest of ADRs companies in the US, other than the five companies it has already identified.  Also, if NIO will let US auditors review its financials, who know it could happen either sooner or later, then a huge turnaround will likely be coming.  If you have the crystal balls, you are more than welcome to let me know.  Meanwhile, all EV companies are going through the 2000-2001 period of the dot coms for now.  Look at Mullen Automotive, almost under half a dollar just two weeks ago.  It is a great time to short stocks.  Even DocuSign with its huge market share is seeing its unbeatable downtrend.  When will be the bottom?  When it is too attractive as far as valuation is concerned and that holding other assets seems stupid compared to coming back to these assets on fire sale.  However, we have not reached that point yet.  When NIO will be $10, that just might happen, but yes, $5 will surely be much better.  I am patient :)",0,FALSE

They mis the point what sort of company nio is. It isn't just a car company. Is't a brand that also sales cars.

For example there is an app and nio products, nio houses its not a dealer its a community center, you don't have to own a nio to come there.

Also the new factory almost online.. This will give a big boost for the new et5 and et7 production. Also the come to a lot of new countries this year.

Than the Factory are not from nio, that als make it easier to invest elsewhere. The battery is a separate service, this already makes a profit and the battery swap is unique for nio. Also the battery lease construction.

I have to be honest with you, i bought at 5 and later at 2 and holding it. I was stupid not to sell then is was skyrocketing, but i was planned to geep it for at least 5 years or 150 if possible. And on the way down i was scared and sold all at i think it was 34... But than it recovered The Day After and the whole next week.. So i bought back.. Fomo..STUPID that move did cost me a lot of money!  But now I'm holding from back than. In my portfolio my position is red but actually I'm still in the positive. Now I'm patient and waiting it out, if it skyrocketing again i sell. If it's a easy recovery and buildup I'm holding. I don't buy more at this level.. I personally think that 20/25 is a Fair price. When below 10 i buy a bit more..

Maybe it should be 5 i don't know, everyday i lose money in this stock right now, but i learn my lesson i don't sell because nio is a strong company. It things change i reconsider.

I wish i did know how to day trade nio because i know the stock so well.. But i don't understand how to buy shorts..

jjxUhRldwgE,@peterklausner9727,2022-09-08T19:12:47Z,"Love your NIO Videos Paul, But here is my take on things.. If NIO is a hype stock than what is Rivian?? Let's compare.. 
*NIO first half deliveries 50827, Market Cap $29B, EPS -$.0.70. 
*Rivian first half deliveries 5694, Market Cap $32B, EPS -$14.53. Rivian delivered 11% of NIO in the first half of the year!!
IMHO NIO at $17 is a gift. & Here are my 8 PILLARS..
1) Profitable in 2024 latest estimates,
2) EU Expansion countries this year Germany Sweden Denmark Netherlands.
3) US Nvidia chip ban won't affect NIO.
4) NEO Park opening this month. & Just making the ET5.
5) ET5 starts deliveries in 22 days, & is expected to deliver 10k/mo by December.
6) 2 sub brands are in the final stages of development $15K--$30K code named Firefly, & $30K--$50K code named Alps.
7) Next year 1800 acre factory to be built within 16950 acre NEO Park for sub brand.
8) $8.1B cash on hand to take them well past the expected profitability in '24.
9) 2023 European expansion countries Austria, Switzerland, France, Spain, Italy, Hungry, Portugal, Belgium, & Czech Republic. 

Looks like NIO might be able to meet the hype expectations..",5,FALSE
jjxUhRldwgE,@EverythingMoney,2022-09-08T22:20:48Z,"Nio and Rivian are both hype , high hopes , yes they are getting better but are not there yet , Nio has the help of the Chinese gov behind them giving them cash to compete with Tesla , and Rivian has the support from Ford and Amazon investing on them + all other investors they got from the IPO, witch i liked that the did ipo and went thro the hole process  not like many others that did spacs .AP",0,TRUE
jjxUhRldwgE,@peterklausner9727,2022-09-08T23:27:30Z,"@@EverythingMoney NIO didn't list in NY via a SPAC.. & NIO did receive bailout cash ONE TIME ONLY from the Chinese government of around $1.2B USD.. Or most likely go bankrupt.. in early 2020 full swing Covid..Hmm tough decision, LoL.. Was in exchange for 24% Ownership of NIO ADR. (NY shares).. However during last year's dilution rounds to raise cash, NIO has sunk a whackload of cash into R&D, & paying back NIO China's 24% stake in NIO ADR, (American Depositary Shares) now 7.89% & non voting for NIO China.. With $8.1B & in the unlikely event of HFCAA violation the remaining balance of that 7.89% to 0% NIO China ownership could easily be obtained.
     You have to admit Even with Amazon & Ford backing.. Rivian is still getting a stupid premium considering being primarily in the US EV market which is 11% globally now. Compared to NIO being in the Chinese EV market that is bigger than Europe & the US EV markets combined!! Also has a better position within that market with EV subsidies being extended until the end of 2023. Also interest rates are going down in China, with BAAS lowering the up front cost of NIO ownership by $10k looks like a winner to me, unmatched in the biggest EV market..
      The NIO ET5 in China alone, from September 30th -Dec 31 2022 will outsell both Rivian & Lucid combined for the whole year of 2022!! With 5 other NIO models & 2 from 2022 alone & EU Expansion...   
    This EV market valuation system of rewarding underperforming US EV companies, & devaluing over performing Chinese EV companies is a problem.. Accounting compliance deal is in place so what is the excuse for devaluing now?? This is a huge inequality in the market, that is intentional by big US based market manipulators..

Stock Moe kept reminding us that he will keep cost averaging into Ethereum and now it is around $4000. Instead of me starting buying at that 1700 range I didn’t listen to him and finally bought when it was about $2700. In my opinion just like Moe I think Ethereum might catch up to bitcoin. I will continue to dollar cost average into the future.,5,FALSE

You have obviously not done your deep dive so you are missing out on crucial information that justifies the company's strategic moves and road to profitability/growth. Also, NIO is not a TESLA copy. They have a completely different, much smarter business setup and they are growing faster than TESLA. To think that TESLA is so far ahead in terms of FSD tells me that you are biased. Please take a look at the latest Mobileye demo. TESLA fsd is trash compared to the competition and will be the last to be permitted by regulators. NIO is developing their own autonomous driving tech with NVIDIA hardware and tools + partner data (most likely mobileye and others) so they have a strong edge right of the bat. What you might possibly be misunderstanding is that NIO is not using their user base as their primary testers. They have unlimited partner data for that.

bZxoKjaFsFs,@stefanospap6288,2022-05-10T22:10:10Z,"@@Pejjy NIO has been pretty clear about their spending. It's calculated reinvestment for R&D and expansion (they are launching multiple new products, expanding charging infrastructure and business worldwide in upcoming years). Money put to good use. If you go back in time and see how NIO's investments played out historically you will understand the impact. NIO has also announced that they are scheduling their first profitable q to be around 2024 and in the meantime the mass market sub-brand that will release around that time as well. Again, it's all calculated. This company is serious, unlike Elon's misleading communication. And once again, NIO is not a TESLA copy. In fact, they are outplaying them decisively if you compare correct timelines + they are dealing with a disastrous pandemic in the mean time too. Remember when TESLA was at the brink of collapse so many times in crucial periods of their growth? Imagine having to deal with the pandemic on top of it. They'd be wiped. NIO is far superior, far smarter in terms of business and it makes total sense because TESLA is a heavily engineering focused company as said by former TESLA IT VP and current NIO US managing director, Ganesh V. Iyer. (There is an interview podcast of him by ""driving with dunne"", I suggest you give it a listen for a basic understanding of the company). But TESLA TO THE MOON amirite?! :D :D :D",1,TRUE

Their deliveries last year seem to wildly change based on the months where chinese consumers had more or less demand for cars. For example December where chinese consumers had expiring benefits buying EVs.
If they had high demand their deliveries should be more stable those months, as they would be delivered as they were produced, sugests to me they are not production constrained but are already at this low numbers demand constrained.
Also the constant launch of new models is another evidence they are having problems with demand, why would you launch new models every 6 months increasing more and more complexity if cant produce enough to satisfy demand on the current models.

xvkiwXGnajM,@paulwilson1500,2022-05-20T10:44:13Z,"@@akm824 There are several reasons why.  First is that none of the other major EV manufacturers (Tesla, VW, Nissan, BYD) have adopted it.  In order to make swapping work, you need coverage of swapping stations so that you can be assured that you can ""refill"" when you go any distance.  Right now all the emphasis is on building out charging stations.  Don't forget that a large percentage of people who have bought EVs can charge from their own homes.  Only a small percentage of charging is done at public stations.  With swapping, you absolutely have to have a network of swap stations to make it work.

The other reason I don't think it will work is psychological and cultural.  In the U.S. - and maybe to a lesser extent in Europe - we have a general philosophy of ""buy-to-own"" when it comes to cars rather than ""buy-to-rent"".  Could that change?  Maybe, but I think there would be a kind of built-in resistance to being beholden to someone else to make driving feasible that could only be overcome by knowing there is a reliable network of swap stations.  It's just too easy to plug in at home.",0,TRUE

NIO @ 8.1% of Tesla deliveries

Tesla Q3 2021 Revenue: 13.76B
NIO Q3 2021 Revenue: 1.3B
NIO @ 9.4% of Tesla

Tesla market cap 822B

Tesla delivery growth for year 2021: 87%
NIO delivery growth for year 2021: 109%
NIO @ 22.44% more delivery growth than Tesla

If NIO was currently as profitable and valued like Tesla, based on current delivery numbers/revenue, NIOs market cap would be 69.87B, and the share price would be $44.93

Given the projected 100% growth and profitability heading into 2023, $80 would be a realistic price target provided the numbers can be met and profitability is achieved.

Risks:
-Delisting, a loss of 80% of trading volume
-Worldwide recession - decreased demand for premium EVs
-Growth stagnation due to increased competition
-Chip shortage
-Battery shortage

Advantages:
-William Li
-Backed by the CCP
-Possible partnership with BYD
-ET5, direct competition for the Model 3
-Lidar, self driving as a service, subscription fees.
-China
-Oil prices
-Global expansion
-Battery swap & Battery as a service, rental fees.
-No fear of battery degradation, resale value
-NIO's control of the 2nd hand market
-Customer service and brand recognition.

""Rivian and Lucid don't make anything""  (paraphrased) - wrong - they do and are. 

You cannot make direct comparison with Ford and GM, not because Teslas is/isn't a car company, or Fisker, Rivian, Lucid, Nio etc... but if nothing else because their factories are built from the ground up as EV production facilities... not a 50 year old converted ICE factory. Ford and GM and ALL the legacy manufacturers have a LONG way to go to catch up to build the priduction, and that's before they get good as software, FSD, battery technology, weight reduciton/efficiency, etc. The only legacy car companies that stand a chance are Hyundai/Kia and VW Group, a sonly they have dedicated EV R&D and priduction in scale now.

A value investor lives in the past, and the growth investor lives in the future.

The reason lot of people don't understand Tesla because they are unable to grasp with fact that there is no car (ICE) company came after 1970s (please don't count Lexus or Acura basically they are Toyotas and Hondas) now someone made a car company with entirely different technology with no infrastructure. Plus this person had to fight big giants in traditional car company and oil industry. 

Look there 2 types of growth, linear and vertical 
iPhone 1 to iphone 13 is a linear growth but iphone 1 itself was a vertical growth from a phone or blackberry or palm reader

Everybody said electric car will fail, everyone said you cannot land rocket.

This is not to bash you but trying to put my point across. That people who invest in  growth company are not stupid.

There are people who are willing to pay because they see a future which lot people can't. These people are not stupid

Think Tesla not as a stock but an ETF

Being able to swap a dated battery for a new one, or upgrade the peripherals is just amazing for those families.   My only worry is delisting, but if China wants to be a global leader in the car industry, they must place nice with the Western Countries.   I do not think the US can afford to cut ties with China by delisting all stocks.

Reason behind the higher valuation multiple for Xpeng is the beat of every month when it comes to deliveries, however also contributing is the announcement to provide SaaS for their autonomous driving and the fact Xpeng expects evtols services in 2024 the earliest.

Nio is being traded for stocks like Rivian and Lucid. I believe this is attributed to the recent sentiment towards China, perception of Chinese companies and favoring companies more closer to home.

Fact is that Xpeng sold more cars in the past months than most analysts anticipated. Your case when it comes to competition could also be applied for Tesla. Clearly their scale and experience gives them the edge and the success is undeniable. 

I follow your channel with great interest and you know your fundamentals however we fundamentally disagree with the potential regarding Xpeng.

H6OBtT-hde0,@HeliTom84,2021-10-01T04:53:44Z,"just to clarify; 
1)Nio  isn’t even close to be no1 most selling EV in China. It’s not even in the top 20s. 
2) Norway isn’t in the EU union, Which every Norwegian is pretty happy with for many reasons. 

Ps: Norway have Exemption of purchase tax and VAT that’s providing large financial incentives for buyers of EV’s. Other benefits include free parking on some public parking spaces, no road toll and free access to ferries connecting national roads. On top of that, we have one of absolute highest prices for petroleum and heavy taxes for dirty fossil cars, which is makes it a no brainer to buy a EV, and that’s why Norway having 75~% of all new car sold as EV and Tesla is by far the no1 most selling car. 

I believe NIO will do good, but the BYD tang haven’t caught on super well yet, and I expect that’s because China products have reputation that can take time to persuade Norwegians to buy China cars compare to a Tesla, Audi Etron or Mercedes eqs. It’s maybe silly, but there’s a ton of Norwegians waiting for teska giga Berlin to start manufacturing because they don’t want to buy the Chinese made versions or even the American made due to poor quality control compared to the Germans. And also because the new battery cells will come in the model Y from Berlin. That said; I have test driven the nio es8 yesterday and I liked it and I will still hold on to my shares.

In our underground garage, one can spot a few Bentleys, lots of Porsches a Pink Maserati, and a Pink Porsche 911 (both driven by teenage girls). The rest are mostly German cars. One very sad exception is our 10-year-old Honda CRV :) which is by far the shyttiest car in the garage.

What I am beginning to see more are NIOs, XPengs, and Li Autos plus the occasional BYD Hans.
Li One is an oddity. Earlier the only other options were Toyota LandCruiser or Buick GL8. Li one is cheaper, PHEV, and looks much better.
XPengs are usually progressive families' second cars. One of my students' dad has a P7, but the girl likes his dad's Range Rover better.

A clear exception is NIO. It is considered to be of better quality and has a higher status than its German counterparts.
This reputation is pure gold for NIO. The Chinese are very brand aware when it comes to cars (and everything else). In their minds, NIO ranks higher than the German brands. NIO's design isn't that flashy, but one can spot a NIO half a mile away. It has that elegance that makes it pop up.
I have had several rides in an ES6 and the car is pure luxury. If one didn't know what car they are sitting in, they would guess a German car twice the prICE ( :) )


Geelys and BYDs one meets here more often as DiDi (Chinese Uber) cars. DiDi drivers work for their money and they use the most cost-effective vehicle for their purposes. I use one several times a week and the ride is as good as any European ICE taxi. WE also have another service, ""CaoCao"" that only uses electric cars. I would prefer them, but their phone app is only in Chinese. DiDi app is in English as well.

NIO is a very expensive car here and will be even more expensive in the west. We're talking about a close to $100k price tag for the top models in the west.

Nvidia supplies the autonomous chips which is the brain of autonomy for self driving, yeah keep smoking someday you’ll wake up.

After a number of swaps the supply of fully charged batteries will be exhausted. During normal daily operation there will be time to charge them for next customer but during the holidays where everyone is travelling this will be more difficult. Nio will not be able to supply more batteries or swapping stations just to accommodate the holiday surge because it will be uneconomical. 2 things that currently helps Nio customers - Nio is quite expensive and less common so battery swapping is still ok as demand is not that great. Also I guess so Nio owners can swap for the bigger battery pack so they may make the trip to their hometown in one go.

Assuming 5 minutes per swap, then only 12 swaps can be done per hour. A set of 12 chargers could provide the same throughput. The problem with charging during peak times is that it becomes a hoarding situation. Because charging is viewed as being in short supply, people hoard it by charging their cars to 100%.  Charging from 80%-100% can take longer than 0%-80%. What the charging stations should do during peak times to increase throughput, and eliminate the hoarding mentality, is double the price per KWh when charging above 80% and quadruple it when charging above 90%. People would realize that their hoarding is going to cost them a lot, so they would leave and that would make the most efficient use of the chargers.",0,FALSE

otEJqxzba1w,@HeliTom84,2021-10-14T08:30:41Z,"Will be interesting to see how it plays out. I’m a bit skeptical about the whole BaaS deal. Is swapping so much better? I will use Tesla as example in this. 
Let’s break it down;

1) if Nio is going to be mass volume car, I don’t think Nio will have enough swap stations for the customer to really have a ~4 minute swap. They will most likely experience queues, and then a 20 min supercharge with Tesla once a week / >500km road trips doesn’t matter at all. Also; most people charge at their home / work here. 

2) each swap stations will be extremely costly. There’s hard to even make enough batteries today for each car, none the less for 14x1000x swap stations. Also, each swap station needs about 5 or 6 full time operators, and here in Norway that’s going to cost a easy $100k a year for each employee that works there. That’s $600k in just salaries, pension and other company taxes for one swap station. 

3) BaaS prices are high per kw compared to a Tesla supercharge price. You’re looking at double the price here in Norway.

4) Nio Norway is claiming it needs 15000km / every service to maintain warranty. If this is true, that’s really bad IMO. Tesla don’t have any service intervals that you have to bring it in for to maintain warranty. 

5) batteries are proven to be long lasting with little degradation and safe and reliable. However If a Tesla needs a new battery, they will change it under 8 year warranty. It’s no hassle for the customer really. You get Tesla lender car meanwhile they do the service in a couple of days or so. 

6) Nio charging speed is slow. Tesla is way faster and it keeps getting faster and faster by the years. Supercharging infrastructure is great here and I’ve never experienced that I have to wait in line to charge. And this is Tesla-land where it’s the no1 most selling car in the country. 
It’s also very quick to set up more superchargers and Tesla will have solar powered supercharger stations in combination with mega packs in the near future.

7) Tesla have done swapping in 90 seconds in the past. Why did they stop doing it ? It’s obvious.

If Pelosi visits Taiwan, it will seriously violate the one China principle and the provisions of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, seriously damage China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and have a serious impact.

(Incidentally, my big $12 NIO position stopped out, just like my big $18 LCID position (literally by $0.02). My two biggest (totally huge) mistakes in the past year).

Alternatively, I'm thinking that NIO's current meandering around $30 might establish a new support. After all, the company was quite a different beast at the time of the old supports. It has its own factory in the pipeline now.

If the share price does halve, I reckon it could happen as part of (precursor to) major bubble deflation, including deflation of the delirious mega caps e.g. AAPL.

Third, they've been spending heavily on R&D to stay ahead of competition. Why would you think that it took them over 1 year to start delivery ET7s starting in March whereas they will take about 9 months to deliver the ET5? They are also doing their FSD, they don't need to announce every little detail to hype up the stock. William Li is no Elon Musk, he doesn't boast his work until it becomes fruitful. He always under promise and over delivery. Tesla and other companies tried battery swaps before them, but was unable to make it commercialized, NIO did. Lastly, everything technology have their pro and cons. If NIO is able to make battery swap commercialized, I am sure they can make the maintenance behind it much better than anyone else.

If anything, BYD has a better chance at outselling Tesla in the US with how fast they’re growing production, and they already have a somewhat larger presence than NIO in the US. 

Now maybe if NIO actually does sub brands (which I don’t necessarily agree with as it’s a legacy automaker approach) with more affordable price tags, then they could possibly compete to be the largest. But they haven’t revealed anything related to a single sub brand yet.

Yes some companies have certainly emerged stronger (exponentially in the last two years) and justified share movements.

Many reported that this as a tool to delist all Chinese companies. Not the case, was a tool to get further accounting oversight out of China to detect & delist fraudulent Chinese companies.. Many of the workings are still being sorted out.. But first a company needs to be identified.. & now from the Chinese side the CSRC has stated that they support VIE'S, where before they were technically illegal!!! Now the CSRC also will allow foreign regulators access to accounting compliance for VIE listed companies!! Some sectors that are telecoms, or companies that are 100% state owned (banks), or other companies that are forbidden due to security reasons obviously won't be included in any VIE structured company listing.. But for the EV sector.. This isn't a sector at risk & is actually a priority for the CCP.. Things very evident like curbing pollution, Tesla being allowed to build a factory in China & have no Chinese 50/50 partner, (a first).. Also the CSRC recently have announced 100% foreign ownership in the NEV sector.. Now this big announcement by June or before... Great news, because I have a few shares of NIO..",1,FALSE

But instead of going up like he predicted, it broke thru the base, and continued down. I've been seeing this pattern fail over and over again. The market is breaking down. 
IT'S A BEAR MARKET. THE FED IS TAPERING. DON'T FIGHT IT. 
The artificial money pumped into the system is being pulled back because of inflation. And because of inflation, no earnings to pump it up. So down this is going.

Right now Saudi state backed Lucid is valued at 6B USD higher than NIO & they delivered 360 EV's in Q1 this year.

I want NIO to delist & I will try my luck on the Heng Seng, or Singapore exchanges..

I have zero confidence in NIO. They are only still in existence because the ccp bailed them out a few times. 

I'm not super confident in SOFI because there is so much competition in this space. 

PLTR has the best outlook of the bunch but the company shows no respect for fiduciary duty. So far they only care about lining their own pockets. A diluted stock is a worthless stock. It doesn't matter how many billions a company makes if they spend it all on their staff. That is a system created to serve themselves and not the stockholder. So until this changes a big fat NO to PLTR. I once held a large position on PLTR until I realized it was a scam and fortunately I was able to unload all of my holdings at a small profit. I would look at several key things to change before investing in them again. They have to reduce employee stock options way down, they need several quarters of stock buybacks, and they have to show consistent sales and  profit growth.",0,TRUE

You can’t automate a gas pump (or, at least, the awkward mechanics of such would preclude efficiency and scalability). This is IDEAL for fleet vehicles and commuters. You don’t have to build 800V infrastructures, degrade batteries quicker with high voltage charging and, consequentially, produce more waste. You don’t have to wait upwards of 30 minutes to get a full charge (queued behind others who also have to wait at least that long). And say there’s a power outage in certain towns/regions, a Nio Power Swap Station housing 10+ charged batteries could provide much needed power to essential services in the vicinity.

- Nio and Li Bin have already shown that they are not very concerned with short term stock market movements, if Nio stock is penalized in the short term by this, good or bad it does not matter to them a lot 
- they have already raised funds several times they do not need cash for the foreseable future (hopefully never again)

Sometimes, I am actually curious to know why a lot of people around the world haven't really accepted cryptocurrencies. I would say cryptocurrency has changed the world.  Regardless of the fact that i have been a trader/investor, we really need more crypto experts to educate investors on the benefit of cryptocurrency, because the world is sailing into a digital world where you don't need banks to  bank your funds and end up with zero interest.  BTC's price has been oscillating lately, which means the market is currently open and you can't tell if it's going to be bearish or bullish. This uncertainty scare most investors away and forces investors to hold. I would say it's totally wrong to sit back waiting and maybe take some losses, this is the wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor it should be up to us to find ways to add more and more coins and stock up on the goal of making a profit. It all depends on the pattern you are trading and also the source of your strategies. I started with 2 BTC and amassed over 5.5 BTC in just 4 weeks with the right trading strategy given to me by an experienced trader, dean vella His methods are top notch and profitable and he can be easily contacted through Telegram (@deanvella1970) and WhatsApp (+33755531299) you can make him your best cryptocurrency expert Right now i look forward amassed all my coin and also trading more assets to change my life and my kids as well, all thanks to dean vella.",34,FALSE

Most people don't like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize. And benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial. Few if any rug pulls.

 the problem I have is like you said it is in China. here are some points to keep front and center the covid policy! and the semiconductors they have to start making there, maybe not too big of a problem? but how does their economy work through the current housing and bank problems that are having everywhere there. Most of their food supplies for growing and energy is imported. If they need to shut down industry, they don't think twice about it. The man in charge has lost touch and no one wants to be the messenger, they know what happens there.  Europe and the world have backed away from a lot of things they make because they have found other ways to get them. So it's not good !

NIO regards AAPL as its primary competitor.

Pre-eminence in Technology is in NIO’s corporate DNA.

NIO is showing clear potential for Technology Leadership in all key areas:

* Doubling of 2022 R&D budget

* Semi Solid-State Batteries

* Battery Swap Infrastructure / Partners

* RoboTaxis

* Level 4 Autonomy / ADaaS

* AR/ VR PanoCinema / World Leading Dolby Immersive Sound  System

* Unparalleled NVDA computing power

* State of the Art QCOM Infotainment

8. De-Listing FUD / Geo-Political Factors

These will always exist with China aspiring for Global Hegemony especially in EVs. However, it will be difficult to argue Sales, Profit & Growth numbers  coupled with:

* Premium Luxury Moat that no other company has

* Technology plus Premium Luxury Status that no other company has

Above 8 are the key factors/ battles, in my opinion, determining NIO Share  Price in upcoming months not current, perhaps soon ending, Covid skirmish.

TA is all well and good but I find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as it seems.

We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. This is the worst possible time in history to invest as so many don't back up their crypto assets. More emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market.I have made over 10.8btc 4rm day tradng with Andrew Tony, insights and signals in less than 4weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish...",0,FALSE

3383BRphymg,@austinlittke7688,2022-03-24T23:57:00Z,"I'd take some when it becomes obvious that perhaps you should. At worst, the stock doesn't pull back significantly and offer you a chance to buy back the shares you sold but you can find another stock underperforming to buy stock in instead, at best, you can double, triple etc the amount of shares you had or secure profit to keep cash on the side. For reference, I remember when nio shot up over 100% at first and my plan was to sell most my shares and put it into tesla which at the time hadn't shot up...didn't end up doing it, but tesla ended up shooting up 100% and Nio did nothing but drop. 

Another instance, i saw my overall portfolio just shoot up a ridiculous amount that looked unnatural, and i knew i should secure all profits and sell everything and just wait for the market to correct, well, needless to say I didn't and the market crashed since then and I lost $100,000.

They are the only company which has shown improvement in cognitive scores after 12 months of treatment.  Absolutely no safety concerns.  So much better than BIIB’s or LLY’s drug which has huge safety concerns and are very expensive to administer.  SAVA’s float is tiny at only 40M shares.

The ET7 and AT5 might change things around for Nio but this is something that should of been done a long time ago like promised.
