When retail can buy AMZN (full shares) for $120 instead of $2,400 (I paid over $3,100), lots more will buy. I know exactly what you mean by it being the same price, but most of retail doesn't look at it that way. GOOGL is splitting 20:1 in July, and a much better investment. That's why I have been averaging down with GOOGL, and not AMZN. BTW, I'm a noob investor, started late February, and didn't hear about the split until after I bought.

Because investors will try to buy as many shares as possible before it gets more expensive.  This competitive move will push the share price up.    Therefore, tomorrow I am buying Amazon shares in a way that when the split arrives..  I will have 2800 shares on my hands on the day of the split...   Next...

At this time in the market, it‚Äôs a little rocky, so you‚Äôre getting in at a decently discounted market. However, there‚Äôs still a little bit of over value in it. Be careful and do as much research as you possibly can. ETF‚Äôs are very good risk management vehicles for your money. Since you‚Äôre new to investing, you should research a number of ETF‚Äôs for your budget. 

My keys for you:
Watch the news- politics are a huge factor. Research economics. Research stocks. Research ETF‚Äôs. Stocks are like sports- you have a game, where a ball is being played with and you have to try and figure out where the ball will be next, so you can get it and score. Inflation means higher prices= look at stocks with pricing power. Rising interest rates are also a common theme- tech stocks get hurt the most from them, but finance stocks do well. 

I hope this helps!

1. Amazon not doing a spin under Andy Jassy, nor if he ever interested in that. I consider this to be risk #1, conglomerates with multiple businesses operated in different industry do fall apart significantly if the management is not qualified to make decisions considering the complexities of their businesses. examples: Johnson & Johnson(consumer products and pharmaceutical), GE(aviation, healthcare, and energy), AT&T. These are the companies that recently did some form of restructuring but there will be more coming.

2. Amazon invest every penny they earned. This both have upside and downside. The upside is Amazon reinvest back to itself, so it can continue to grow. The downside is it return no profit to shareholders. How am I assured that 10 years from now, Amazon will grow nonstop and remain unbeatable. Amazon and its management have huge ambitions but they also need to pay attention to capital allocation.

3. True value in Amazon is difficult to calculate. If we break Amazon down to B2B(AWS), B2C(eCommerce, Prime, Kindle, Ads), how much does AWS worth, and how much does eCommerce worth? Can eCommerce survive without the cash flow from AWS? Can Amazon face less scrutiny if Amazon is breakup into two (with less market multiple on Amazon.com given low profit margin)? Can B2C be split further into eCommerce with ads, and prime that provide better experience for any consumers(not just Amazon) whenever they use free shipping, music, video, kindle (those bundled features) and eventually become a subscription powerhouse.

4. Union, government anti-trust law (both EU, US) both poses managerial risk to Amazon. Union is troublesome given the massive labor force that Amazon logistic have. and Anti-trust, how can it sounds logically and politically correct if Amazon is both competing with its 3rd party merchant and selling its own merchandise. Will the advertisement create a bad reputation that the poor-quality products been displayed first to the users.

when a company does not pay out dividend, you would only expected to profit if someone else will buy your stock. as an investor, you will have less options to make money. Hence investors need a higher margin of safety, but since Amazon is difficult to assess, it become hard to even begin with. That's okay if you are young, but for me, as I enter into my 30s, my 40, my 50. I would expect to have greater dividend payout. Does this change in investment style require me to sell Amazon and pay long term capital taxes to the government?",2,FALSE

VLEU4YG95cw,@helshabini,2022-07-26T10:56:24Z,"FYI, the AWS commitments are usually spent over multiple years, not a single year. So you can expect those $89b to become revenue over the next 3-5 years. The reason they do it is that big companies can get AWS service at a discount if they commit to using it for the long term. So big companies project their cloud spend over time, and make those large commitments. The nature of these commitments are also usually backloaded, since for any given company they expect their cloud spend in the first year of the contract to be significantly less than the last year, as they grow and migrate more and more stuff to the cloud over the length of the commitment. 
This is not to discount the fact that $89b of commitments is huge. But just to take into perspective a more accurate representation of how and when those dollars are going to hit Amazon's financial statement.",1,FALSE

After that, when you compare the remaining businesses of both companies, I would say Microsoft wins hands down, no questions asked. Amazon competes in a million different businesses and wins many of them, but at high cost, with it eating most(if not all) of their Margin. Microsoft doesn't have this issue. Microsoft is almost like combining the best parts of Netflix, Adobe, AWS and Salesforce into a single company that pays dividends, and with a larger moat than any would have individually.

It's difficult to make an argument for AMZN at substantially more than market weight but I appreciate the bull thesis.

It's not much different than the bull thesis for WMT: The costs will be brought down substantially and that will increase margins. 

The big returns for discount retail (WMT then and AMZN now) are when the companies were growing fast, new stores for WMT and new FC for AMZN - once growth slows discount retail is low margin and not much room on cost control when you are already WMT and AMZN.

If the stock is $3000, you would need a portfolio of $2-$4 million if you did not want AMZN to be too big a portion of your portfolio. However, if it were $150, you could buy 100-200 shares of AMZN and be able to sell calls on it easily.

The average cost of charging a rivian van is $10.80, however that‚Äôs for consumers and amazon is the largest consumer of green energy in the US. By the end of 2020 they already had 64 wind turbines and covered numerous factories in solar panels and were generating 6.8GW.

This does not even include the synergies in costs it‚Äôs huge investments in green energy implies for lowering the margins across their businesses.

tw7_HJLPVi0,@trent1615,2022-06-10T23:01:15Z,"Why would anyone put money into Amazon over Tesla? Look Amazon is a perfectly good investment they have an excellent e-commerce business, cloud computing (that‚Äôs where the majority of revenue comes from) and still some upside and now an excellent advertising component. Here‚Äôs the problem lots of competition in these areas with some big dogs like Facebook, Microsoft,google and apple. Amazons best growth days are behind and will grow well but likely in the mid teens. Tesla has a better balance sheet similar Forward PE a much better PEG. Will likely grow at a 50% plus at least for the next five years. They are also competing against legacy automotive companies which when compared to great companies like google, Facebook, apple and Microsoft they are a joke and half a decade behind Tesla and many will likely go bankrupt failing to transition from ICE to EV. Beyond just the opportunity Tesla has with EV they are also disrupting energy sector which has the largest TAM, insurance, FSD licensing, robo Taxi and more. So while Amazon is a perfectly fine company I just can‚Äôt justify putting capital into them when Tesla is trading at a similar forward PE but has a much longer runway for growth. Global EV sales being about 7% that within the next 10-15 years will be 100%. The Robo Taxi opportunity alone is almost impossible to evaluate it would be like trying to value the TAM of the internet back in the early 90s we just know the opportunity is likely in the Trillions and Tesla is in the lead widening the gap every day. So when you sit back and compare Amazons optionality to Tesla they are not even in the same league. Just look at the fundamentals profit margins, operating margins, return on assets and return on equity Tesla is better in every category. Also like I already pointed out who would you rather compete with google, fb, apple and Microsoft or competing against trash legacy automotive companies like GM and Ford? On top of that Tesla is lead by Elon like him or not he maybe the greatest CEO of this generation. If someone can tell me how Amazon is a better investment than Tesla I would love to hear.",0,FALSE

I feel like my family and I have benefitted greatly from the information you've shared here. I've got great respect for you, and that's why I'm asking this question. What do you think of Amazon's corporate ethics? 

I myself have tried to research this, and from what I've found, I disagree with many of their business practices: harsh working conditions, predatory marketing/manufacturing, and just the overall monopolistic nature of their business. Are they innovative? Sure! Have they produced great returns for their shareholders? Absolutely! But at what cost to the world? I think you can argue that they have hurt mom & pop businesses, they take advantage of the people that sell on their platform, and they do not treat at least some of their warehouse employees with respect.

It's for these and other reasons that I am not buying AMZN stock buy itself. I'm invested in VTI and VOO, so I've made a judgment call there, but that's where I've drawn the line for me. I genuinely would love to hear your thoughts on this topic, and I think a lot of other people would, too.

tw7_HJLPVi0,@brandont5408,2022-03-13T19:51:31Z,"Mimi stock splits and reverse splits are simple enough. I will give two scenarios that hopefully help give clarity on what these terms mean.

Scenario 1.) A Stock Split. In 2020 Tesla decided to split their stock at a 5:1 ratio. Meaning shareholders went from owning one stock to five stocks. Tesla did this because the value per share was $2,213.40 and they wanted to reduce the cost per share so they could attract a broader range of investors who would buy at the lower price. So if you owned this stock you would have went from owning one stock at $2,213.40 to five shares valued at $442.68 which collectively would have been worth the same amount as before the split. Over time these individual shares climbed in value from $442.68 to a peak of $1,144.76 before dropping with the rest of the market in recent months.

Scenario 2.) Reverse Split. Basically the exact opposite of a split where a company combines shares to boost the price per share. This can be done for many reasons, but is often done to get stocks values above $5.00 as anything below is often considered penny stocks, and can face some trading restrictions by brokerages. So in this scenario a stock worth $1.00 in a 1:10 reverse split would become worth $10.00, but instead of having ten shares you would now have only one.

Hopefully that clarifies the terminology for you. If you have any further questions I am sure others here will be glad to help.",22,TRUE

Of course they won't be selling for 100 PE. But at the very least 25.
We can't assume (for simulation purposes, not that we actually believe it will happen) a 22% revenue growth and use at the same time the argument ""I'm going with a PE of 18 because they are big so they will have a harder time growing"". 22% revenue growth for a company with the size of Amazon is huge, and should be treated as such.

I never said Amazon was fairly priced. In fact, to make it clear, I believe it's way overvalued.
You fail completely to understand the assumptions for the future that are being made. Which makes this discussion pointless, because clearly we are talking about different things.
""not to mention amazon's p/e requires 35%+ cagr to be justified"" in this line you just proved my exact point. Growth obviously matters. And Paul increased the revenue growth from 14% to 22%, and didn't adjust the P/E. This is my point. 
I never said the current P/E of Amazon is realistically sustainable, I never said that Amazon was currently fairly priced for a 12.5% rate of return, I never said that only growth matters.

Currently in my state were offering $3000-$5000 starting bonuses on top of starting wage of $16.75 on top of temporary $12 premium. So new hires can come in and make almost $30 for brain dead work for the next 2-3 months
Right now alot of our FCs are doing MET so mandatory Overtime 50-60hrs a week with a $2 peak pay raise(some offering a $2 hazard pay as well) and double OT pay.
Idk how much our own associates across the business have an effect on the stock price but with that kinda pay a T1 associates is making about $5800-$7200 a month before taxes, benefits, 401k, stock purchase, etc.

(u value patent at how much it acquire it (fair value), but in the industry, that patent could make a company live or die in the industry).

ZFtEP6YxX0c,@georgeconstanza6505,2022-05-03T22:23:54Z,"I did a bit of research on this clown and this is what I have found: He claims that he started investing around 2008 and has 30% average rate of return over that time frame - highly unlikely. When you look at the time he joined YouTube and posted link to his portfolio it coincides with the 2020 crash and big influx of retail coming in to the stock market. When you look at his return and compare them to S&P 500 - they are pretty much following the market! So, my theory is this - he knows about markets enough to eke out a profit unlike LaFufu and other grifters but he is no Warren Buffet or Peter Lynch. Otherwise if he really had 30% average rate of return for more than a decade he would get headhunted and he would work for some large hedge fund or in some other capacity on Wall Street! If you are that smart why are you on YouTube instead of making $$$ millions on Wall Street bro? Last time I checked they make pretty decent money up there and are always hiring new talent. His oldest videos are on Tesla, Nikola, Nio, Bitcoin and other click baits! Now he is getting some affiliate money from affiliate advertising and from selling his newsletter! So, I think LaFufufu is a big grifter and will cost you a lot of money in a short time frame - Popular Investor is more of a ""financial advisor"" that knows that it is not a good long-term business to recommend shitty companies but that there is a lot of money to be made from fees aka subscriptions and affiliate links and YouTube add revenue! And as long as he is in line with the market somewhat - he can keep saying - don't worry guys - the next quarter/year we will really outperform the market. The last quarter/year we under-performed or were pretty much in line with the market for - this and that reason - all kinds of excuses - he will give you his ""Wall Street lingo"" and the show goes on! So unlike Lafufu you won't a lose a lot of money in a short period of time but you might lose a lot of money in a longer time frame - not sure what is worse? Also, you have to think about how his average holding time of 5,5 months will affect you when you have to file your taxes and your capital gains! And lastly 100% agree on EBITDA - expense is an expense - you can pretend it is not but you don't get to choose the reality that you live in! You don't say to your wife our earnings (discretionary spending money) this month before mortgage payments, car payments and utilities payments were this number - so the fact that we are just getting by is not true! If it wasn't for those things we would have all this free cash to spend on vacations, eating out, etc... Bunch of nonsense - but he is so smart - he knows so much ""Wall Street Lingo"" he must know it all right? Kind of reminds me The Wolf Of Wall Street movie - you can be like LaFufu and try to go after small fish with $1000 in their accounts or you can go after white collar professional with 100,000 or 1,000,000 to invest - same concept but for ""bigger fish"" you will need better ""sales pitch""!!!",3,FALSE

- i also understand that accounting standards can be inflexible, time consuming, and sometimes doesn't reflect the reality, but it provides grounds to compare between companies (but it still varies) 

- time value of money is a tool, but discount rate is subjective. everyone has their way to value a stock. stock price is the average of everyone expectation, if u are too hawkish, u can never buy a stock. (because ur buy in price is too low), the fact that u report contract income and discount it back also reflect how accounting standards itself can be base on assumption. 

- for example - average people don't even look at depreciation / amortization, they care about cash flow. The company already spent that money. (useful life is so subjective, most of the time building.) - people only look at cash flow is because of the assumption that cash is what keep the company afloat, and for tech, it would mean more R&D. the fact that if u don't have cash flow. the company will sink. 

Accountants cannot be pigeon hole in accounting principles. people like amazon because of their multi business stream. they evolve. they are entering new business, new market, finding new ways to make revenue. looking PE is flat out retarded. u will never find amazon at 20 PE (u will never get an opportunity to buy amazon at 20FPE / PE ) - average tech company. just because amazon premium is base on their multi stream business.",0,TRUE

For one, Amazon's capex is gigantic and thus is hard to fathom. Last year, they spent double the entire value of Walmart' existing infrastructure, and that project was just in the US. They also spend more on R&D than the other FAANG stocks combined. 

Going further, I'd say Amazon is the very definition of a spawner. In the last quarter, they announced they are going to lisence the tech behind their checkout-less stores that are estimated to decrease the expenses of running a brick and mortar store by up to 70%. This naturally provides a collosal market. Amazon's retail side also looks to be flourishing a brighter future with the Buy with Prime function allowing Amazon utilise their logistics service for items sold through third parties.

I think it's really cool how much you're putting into the channel to help it grow, I think youtube channels grow exponentially so the first bit can be a real slog but it's inspiring to see you just calmly putting in the hours to make the vids. And yeah I really like them so I appreciate it.

I really think re amazon the etailer half of the business is close to worthless. The narrative was always that they would lose money while scaling and then at scale they could increase margins and rake in loads of cash, but the truth is competition is so fierce that they won't ever be able to raise prices imo. Shopify, ebay, pinterest, other people's web stores etc, there's really no moat in etail.

I think honestly AWS is the only really good bit of the business, I think it's kind of worth modelling the two parts separately just because they're so different in terms of margins and capital requirements.

So yeah I'm probably rather more negative on it than you are.",2,FALSE
9onkioE4Wfc,@HEJInvesting,2022-02-04T16:08:02Z,"Thank you man, really appreciate that. I'll continue investing in the idea of this channel and the production of the videos as it grows and I prove to myself that I can generate a growing audience. It definitely is a slog, and I'm glad you mentioned the hours because on the surface the assumption from most people (and it's understandable) is that people making videos don't spend much time doing it, when in reality, a lot goes into them. With that being said, getting to talk about something I'm genuinely interested in and then hear other perspectives and counter arguments is great and makes the challenge a lot easier! 

I get your point regarding the ecommerce segment, it's a fair argument considering the current margins. My perspective is that people will be happy to pay premiums (whether that be in the price of the products themselves, or indirectly through a subscription like Prime) for the convenience (i.e. same day/next day delivery and also a shop that sells literally anything/everything) that Amazon offers which should help to drive margins. Competition is definitely fierce but I think with them being an early dominator in this space, it has generated them the capital to be able to lay all of the infrastructure down (i.e. huge fulfilment centres in most built-up areas) which means other businesses can't compete in terms of their offering and efficiency. 

Valuing the businesses separately definitely makes a lot of sense though, we can agree on that haha! As a ""back of the envelope valuation"" I think AWS could easily command a 10x P/S ratio in the current market based on sector, growth and margins, so approximately $600bn for that business. What do you think?",1,TRUE

Yeah I think that's a fair valuation for AWS, I mean 38% growth in a year is really impressive. I also think that as time goes on more and more businesses will move into the cloud and start using AI which means there is a lot of room to grow here, giant future market potential. 

I've also heard it's quite hard to switch clouds, as you need to move all your data and pipelines and retain all your staff. So yeah that's quite important, once people are in they're probably pretty sticky.

I do see your point that having a giant fulfilment network already built out is really valuable. It may also have some synergies, like businesses that start out selling on Amazon might naturally move into AWS as they grow.",0,TRUE

Not paying a dividend is perfectly fine because they are a company trying to grow, so a dividend wouldn‚Äôt make sense right now.

I have had my eye on them, and I would honestly go to their investor relations page and read their annual report and CEO statement to get a feel of where they are and where they plan on going.

Here is my thought process on it, Amazon reported very low earnings is the reason. But they have built so many new facilities all over USA to accommodate way more quantity and building isn‚Äôt cheap, that took away from earnings. Also hikes in wages and gas take away from earnings. Once the oil issue is addressed, which it can‚Äôt be much longer with the huge push in pumping more oil from so many sources, the transportation costs will go way down adding the extra money to the earnings reports, and less money put into building infrastructure will add to earnings. High wages are the big if in my opinion. Will unionizing take from earningS? A big yes. So unionizing good for workers not investors. 
Could they switch entire transportation fleet to electric? That would be ideal long term but could hurt short term with the prices of lithium and chips rising. They want to get away from fossil fuels, so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they do it soon. Cause lithium prices are probably gonna go up till we are dead.

In Q4 AWS report 62B in revevue and 19B in operating income (72% of Total operating income). This mean more operating margin in future, more EPS and FCF.

Wondering whether you can clarify why you believe that is the case (last 20 years for Amazon has been amazing, but we'll see if it can do the same for next 20 years versus Alibaba's US-China tensions, etc. etc. may drive short-term negative sentiment but they're essentially business as usual).

R-r2ynBm3nI,@Shounen_Mania,2022-02-14T20:21:46Z,"‚Äã@@Value-Investing Sure, about the first part of your statment, but I think people are using Munger's endorsement of BABA to support to bullishness a little too loosely sometimes. BABA's total value in the Daily Journal's portfolio is less than $100M, while Berkshire holds at least $1B. 

Personally, I do not use Buffett/Munger/Berkshire/etc.'s trading activity as a strong buy/sell indicator in isolation. 

For example, you have recently said in light of FB's last earnings that the risk-reward is average at best, but that is assuming you take management's guidance and the near-term weakness/uncertainty at face value. FB's reality labs aside, Buffett has stated in the past that it's ad business is a great business despite not investing in it. FB has had big selloffs and huge uncertainties in the past that they managed to overcome each time. There are other content creators on Youtube that have acknowledged that there's a possibility that FB is setting a low bar for themselves and sandbagging. 

Honestly, I already acknowledged the cheaper aspect that we all know already, but to be honest I'm a bit disappointed that ""Munger is buying"" is the response when I was expecting that you had some other conviction about BABA over AMZN. I suppose we're all responsible for forming our own convictions and I can't expect more from a Youtube comment.",1,TRUE

YAzUMKDRtA0,@JY88168,2022-07-28T23:37:57Z,Amazon commerce / retail segment has a lower profit margin than Walmart and doesn‚Äôt that make you wonder why?  How‚Äôs it possible for a brick and mortar giant to have higher profit margin than a company like Amazon?  The reason is simple: traditional accounting methods that allow Walmart to amortize physical properties while a company like Amazon spends so much on r&d that cannot be amortized.  Does r&d count as investment and does that translate to ROI in the future?  I‚Äôm pretty sure we all know the answer to that.  For companies like Amazon you can‚Äôt take their numbers from 10K so literally or you will always think the price is super inflated.  I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs cheap at this level but I also won‚Äôt wait till it drops another 50% as that number just doesn‚Äôt make sense for this company,0,FALSE

You have to ask yourself what kind of growth is necessary in order to justify the price tag of a company.
Amazon reached a high of 188 in 2021. If I expect a 10% return per year, assume their free cashflow margins remain at 2020 levels and assume a terminal P/FCF multiple of 20, I need them to grow their revenue 25% per year over the next 5 years (and then half that in years 6-10) in order to justify that 188 price tag.
Amazon's revenue was 470b last year: if you grow that 25% per year for 5 years you get 1.5T. Stop to think for a moment: the GDP of France is 2.6T. Do you think that makes sense? I guess it is certainly possible, but are you willing to bet on that, risking a substantial portion of your net worth?
A value investor essentially makes no bets: he chooses businesses that are straightforward to understand, and are thus easy to value, and buys them at a discount.
That is what Buffet, Lynch or Pabrai do.
I think we can all agree that their process does work. It is a matter of having a solid screening process, monitoring a watchlist of companies that you understand well, and going in big when opportunities materialize (which is generally the moment of maximum market pessimism).

What was once an asset is now a liability, if there's anything we learned in 2020 it's that physical locations have their setbacks. Fintechs like Sofi are unburdened by infrastructure that legacy banks have spent decades maybe even centuries building (maybe their coffins), because of this they can pass those savings on the consumer and produce even more competitive rates (once bank charter is approved)!

Everyone said ""omg legacy automakers will crush TESLA they'll just start making electric vehicles and then Tesla will disappear"" and yet Tesla stands hear with over a TRILLION dollar market cap surpassing the top 5 automakers. Why didn't the legacy automakers just crush Tesla? Because they had sunk so much money into developing the ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicles which are inferior to electric aka they were encumbered. On top of that their distribution method ended up hurting them  and trying untangled themselves from that distribution route would have bankrupted some of them. Tesla had a significant technological advantage & started first & also they were unencumbered by the outdated infrastructure. The same thing is happening with Sofi, banks are tangled up in all these physical branches which before technology were necessary but now are a burden. You want a clear competitive advantage against legacy banks 1. unencumbered by expensive outdated infrastructure 2. technology 3. management 4. one of the highest if not the highest lifetime value of a customer 5

Most of the world including retail traders I think still don't understand that Amazon isn't just an online retailer. They've got around 20 major divisions many of which are still in early growth stages but going to pay off in the next couple of years and Wed Services is hugely profitable and still growing. Plus of course the whole load of Prime members that signed up during lockdowns will mostly stay. Many of them weren't big online shoppers before but now Amazon will be a regular option for them so even gloomy outlooks on their retail performance is overblown.  Palantir is growing really nicely and I think they're underestimating the impact large sales teams will have because they lack experience with them. I'm sure they're also working on other products/services or just adding to their existing platforms making them even better which will only ever increase contract size and longevity.,4,FALSE

VFO-FswT_zQ,@mkbbk7722,2022-03-16T13:54:15Z,"As an FBA Seller for 3 years I would like to offer my bearish perspective. 
- Overall marketplace GMV is dropping 
- Competition between sellers is fierce, meaning that seller margins are compressing, this is why amazon is still growing mainly due to ADS, yet this isnt sustainable.
- For myself an average seller on the side with low six figure turnover, even a 5-10% loss in margin would make the whole FBA business unprofitable, meaning that for a lot of sellers there is a breaking line where they will leave the platform, which in return will loose in attractiveness due to lower variability and after consolidation higher prices. 
- AWS: Quick point to AWS, as a lot of talking points are about how it will carry amazon stock to new heights, competition is really coming PLUS: AWS customer base has a systematic risk with the number of customers that are unprofitable, for instance VC backed startups, of which a high amount will fail. 
- Europe and the US have more socialist regimes now, tax optimization will not work as well anymore
- Higher marginal cost per package delivered, due to higher minimum wage and higher gas prices, the EV infrastructure will take at least 10 more years to be able to replace fossil and will require substantial investment from amazon TODAY.
- Geopolitical tensions: Where do you think all the junk on amazon is from? Yes, its china, whether you buy a cycling pump or a new phone charger, its 90% from china. Tariffs, etc. could sweep those products of the marketplace soon PLUS most of it is garbage and people are becoming much more sensitized toward buying less and buying less junk.
- Global supply chain issues: in short: For packages from China I have paid 4x to 2 years ago lately. All this is eating into margins, margins matter as previously said to keep depth of inventory etc. high. 

in Summary: IMO Amazon will half within 24 months.",1,FALSE
