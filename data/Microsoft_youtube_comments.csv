[41:20]
Till, when they reach it, their ears and their eyes and their skins testify against them as to what they used to do.

[41:21]
And they say unto their skins: Why testify ye against us ? They say: Allah hath given us speech Who giveth speech to all things, and Who created you at the first, and unto Whom ye are returned.

[41:22]
Ye did not hide yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should testify against you, but ye deemed that Allah knew not much of what ye did.

[41:23]
That, your thought which ye did think about your Lord, hath ruined you; and ye find yourselves (this day) among the lost.

[41:24]
And though they are resigned, yet the Fire is still their home; and if they ask for favour, yet they are not of those unto whom favour can be shown.

[41:25]
And We assigned them comrades (in the world), who made their present and their past fairseeming unto them. And the Word concerning nations of the jinn and humankind who passed away before them hath effect for them. Lo! they were ever losers.

[41:26]
Those who disbelieve say: Heed not this Qur‚Äôan, and drown the hearing of it; haply ye may conquer.

[41:27]
But verily We shall cause those who disbelieve to taste an awful doom, and verily We shall requite them the worst of what they used to do.

[41:28]
That is the reward of Allah‚Äôs enemies: the Fire. Therein is their immortal home, payment forasmuch as they denied Our revelations.

[41:29]
And those who disbelieve will say: Our Lord! Show us those who beguiled us of the jinn and humankind. We will place them underneath our feet that they may be among the nethermost.

[41:30]
Lo! those who say: Our Lord is Allah, and afterward are upright, the angels descend upon them, saying: Fear not nor grieve, but hear good tidings of the paradise which ye are promised.

[41:31]
We are your protecting friends in the life of the world and in the Hereafter. There ye will have (all) that your souls desire, and there ye will have (all) for which ye pray.

[41:32]
A gift of welcome from One Forgiving, Merciful.

[41:33]
And who is better in speech than him who prayeth unto his Lord and doeth right, and saith: Lo! I am of those who are muslims (surrender unto Him).

[41:34]
The good deed and the evil deed are not alike. Repel the evil deed with one which is better, then lo! he, between whom and thee there was enmity (will become) as though he was a bosom friend.

[41:35]
But none is granted it save those who are steadfast, and none is granted it save the owner of great happiness.

[7:38]
He saith: Enter into the Fire among nations of the jinn and humankind who passed away before you. Every time a nation entereth, it curseth its sister (nation) till, when they have all been made to follow one another thither, the last of them saith unto the first of them: Our Lord! These led us astray, so give them double torment of the Fire. He saith: For each one there is double (torment), but ye know not.

[7:39]
And the first of them saith unto the last of them: Ye were no whit better than us, so taste the doom for what ye used to earn.

[7:40]
Lo! they who deny Our revelations and scorn them, for them the gates of heaven will nor be opened not will they enter the Garden until the camel goeth through the needle‚Äôs eye. Thus do We requite the guilty.

[7:41]
Theirs will be a bed of hell, and over them coverings (of hell). Thus do We requite wrong-doers.

[7:42]
But (as for) those who believe and do good works - We tax not any soul beyond its scope - Such are rightful owners of the Garden. They abide therein.

[7:43]
And We remove whatever rancour may be in their hearts. Rivers flow beneath them. And they say: The praise to Allah, Who hath guided us to this. We could not truly have been led aright if Allah had not guided us. Verily the messengers of our Lord did bring the Truth. And it is cried unto them: This is the Garden. Ye inherit it for what ye used to do.

[7:44]
And the dwellers of the Garden cry unto the dwellers of the Fire: We have found that which our Lord promised us (to be) the Truth. Have ye (too) found that which your Lord promised the Truth ? They say: Yea, verily. And a crier in between them crieth: The curse of Allah is on evil- doers,

[7:45]
Who debar (men) from the path of Allah and would have it crooked, and who are disbelievers in the Last Day.

[7:46]
Between them is a veil. And on the Heights are men who know them all by their marks. And they call unto the dwellers of the Garden: Peace be unto you! They enter it not although they hope (to enter).

[7:47]
And when their eyes are turned toward the dwellers of the Fire, they say: Our Lord! Place us not with the wrong-doing folk.

[7:48]
And the dwellers on the Heights call unto men whom they know by their marks, (saying): What did your multitude and that in which ye took your pride avail you ?

[7:49]
Are these they of whom ye swore that Allah would not show them mercy ? (Unto them it hath been said): Enter the Garden. No fear shall come upon you nor is it ye who will grieve.

[7:50]
And the dwellers of the Fire cry out unto the dwellers of the Garden: Pour on us some water or some wherewith Allah hath provided you. They say: Lo! Allah hath forbidden both to disbelievers (in His guidance),

[7:51]
Who took their religion for a sport and pastime, and whom the life of the world beguiled. So this day We have forgotten them even as they forgot the meeting of this their Day and as they used to deny Our tokens.

A token salary that pegs to the poverty line shall be distributed equally among office holders, from president to senator, you'll represent We the People by being We the People. No trading for immediate family, investing through 3rd party entites only. THAT'S NOT FAIR. 
No. That IS fair. What not fair is would be the taxation through inflation because of your guys' poor management of the consortium of bankers aka the Federal Reserve of Organized Crime. What Not Fair is, is you voting every dann year to give yourself a raise off our backs when your almost all doing a p/ss poor job. I'll not continue with the rest because my point isn't about fairness, the Reptile just struck a nerve whilst typing...

But what all of these congress people do from the ones who go into congress incredibly wealthy (like the congress person who owns the Empire State Building) to people like Pelosi is to trade inside information - which is conveniently illegal for anyone to do not in congress! Another example, Susan Rice made millions in the market after only a couple of years. Really Susan? Susan probably wouldn't even know the difference between a call and a put but she does know both Barrack and Biden. These guys sell connections and influence and business buys into it - as it is a competitive world - why else do you think that 230 has never been enforced? And just exactly how did President Biden make his millions? And tell me again just exactly how did Hunter Biden transfer from Georgetown Law to Yale Law to graduate? (Hint. Just check to see how much Yale got in government grants during this same period?)Tell me, I understand that Hunter is the smartest man that President Biden has ever known but just exactly how smart would that make President Biden? The only reason I write you is because I know that you are one smart woman who knows something about both the market and China and what most of the people in Washington have never figured out is how our economy is now totally dependent on China's economy; but, China's economy is moving away from being totally dependent on ours. If President Biden really wanted to turn the polls around all he has to do is to start holding legitimate press conferences once a week?  It has been four months without one press conference where the reporters line up and actually ask questions on multiple topics (of THEIR choosing) which haven't had to be pre submitted? Hint!  President Biden will never again hold a legitimate press conference on anything - at the most he will walk in - read his teleprompter - then turn around and walk out! Every time he does this B.S. he insults everyone in this country whether they voted for him or not!

This has been going on forever and must be stopped. They're set salary is design for comfortable living while serving their country and not to be infused with basically illegal money from what they're making decisions on.

You only need 10,811 shares of T to earn $12,000 per year in dividends. There are 4 quarters in a year, remember?

Business that can employ capital and get above average returns (compared to competitors) deserve a premium. Apple has one of the biggest competitive advantage in the market and no company is ever going to take away any market share from them(in the near future) therefore they deserve a premium since regular businesses profit(margins) will always return towards the mean(since theres a lack of competitive advantage.)

As long as google is alive they will never sell for a PE below 25. And if they did I‚Äôd take on the biggest loan ever and put it all in google.

The danger in only investing in low multiple companies is that theres a big chance they trade at low multiples for a good reason. Low multiples don‚Äôt mean shit if the future growth of cashflows is also low!

Like peter lynch said: I‚Äôd rather have a business with a PE of 20 that grows at 25% a year than a business with a PE of 15 that grows at 11% a year. 

Just buying low multiples companies is never going to work out.

I have one question that has been confusing me a lot: when comparing the numbers on your software (e.g. revenue, net income, free cash flow) to the numbers on yahoo finance, seeking alpha, morning star I find, that these numbers do not match up. The tendency is always right but they're not the exact same. It cannot be because of rounding etc. the gaps are too big. 
Shouldn't the numbers on your software be the exact same as the ones on other websites? Am I doing something wrong?

Please enlighten me like you always do :)

Speaking directly to the ""trifecta"", earnings growth, market multiple expansion, and share buybacks, I am curious why you are ambivalent on dividend payout/reinvestment. Especially in a case like MSFT where the valuation was extremely low and a shareholder could have been underwater for ~10 years, it seems like a nice consistent GROWING stream of dividends (reinvested continuously) would turbocharge returns in the same way that the trifecta does. Any thoughts there?

Thanks again and GREAT WORK!

I think the multiples evaluation is accurate, META is an outlier below, but ADBE is an outlier above. I believe APPL is the best comparison, at 25 P/E. Also, I'm not convinced MSFT can maintain a 17% growth rate, that's extremely high for a Mega Cap, who's competing with another Mega Cap for marketshare. As a holder of MSFT I would love to be proved wrong though.

All this said, overall, I still agree with your assessment that MSFT is a buy. Keep up the great videos! The channel will keep growing",3,FALSE

But it does show an affect with the options chain especially if it‚Äôs a big TLT play or something like that. But typically when you would share the strike price that particular option would get bid up more than what it‚Äôs value should be and that could be dangerous for someone who doesn‚Äôt know better and just buys it because you bought it. But in the end it‚Äôs your judgement not mine that‚Äôs just something I‚Äôd like to share. Also one other thing If you want to know what strike he goes for with TD ameritrade you can see all time and sales for every option traded in that day. So if Josh gives you the expiration you can just filter the options out by the expiration date and boom there you go.

They switched both Windows and Office to ""freemium"" services betting to make money from putting ads everywhere, and selling user information. I don't think a lot of companies would pay microsoft for advertising knowing 90% of home users would disable the ads and run either windows 10 or windows 7. I can safely say without companies like my employer paying monthly for for outlook and microsoft teams, Microsoft isnt going to make a lot of money from ""windows"" anymore.
HALO is another failure as people just dont want to pay 5$ for the color ""blue"" anymore.
The only ways I see them making money is the XBOX services and the government subsidizing them with billions $$$ to keep harvesting user information.

But the main issue here is the current war which seems is going to sprout into other small wars happening in the next 5 years, combined with new covid strains...and that kills tech ""meme"" stocks.
Gabriel said it himself that he sees a big market fall coming and the only stocks that can survive are defense stocks, pharmaceutical stocks (people need their drugs) and utility stocks.

And LOL, when Seth said ""Etherium"" for what Apple can do with its free cash flow! haha! Okay, please you guys could you respond? This is IMPORTANT, I've got a question precisely about these 3 companies. You guys are smart, I have to know if Google, Apple and Microsoft's share prices and/or company valuations will be reduced by the anti-trust legislation against giant tech. Some members of congress are trying to implement some handcuffs such as Apple not favoring its own products in the Apple app store, and Google not favoring its own ads or products in its advertising on its search engine. Kinda minor stuff it seems for now, unless one sees it as the beginnings of more and more anti-trust controls. I'm heavily invested in these three companies, they're the ones I'm honing in on as my long-term nest egg. I don't think they fit the mold of ""old dinosaurs"" at all, I think they are a new phenomenon: giant companies that innovate like small caps but with tons of money. Paul, don't forget that their 4th qrtr 2021 free cash flows were Google $162Billion, Microsoft$130 Billion, Apple $60Billion. That's just unheard of. These are giants with even larger potential than most people realize. Google's smartphone doesn't quite measure up to the iPhone quite yet, but Google's got $162Billion in play money to fix that. And the Apple Car is starting to come to life and Apple has plenty of their own funding to compete with Tesla and the army of new EVs, without needing to create debt. And Microsoft's Azure/Cloud and their new growth engine to compete with Google, and the new Microsoft Chrome PC laptop. These three giants are poised to out-innovate small tech AND they are self funded - no need for debt, which should mean higher valuations for all 3 fairly soon. But is the anti-trust legislation going to effect their price and valuations? Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! (I'll look into your Patreon!)",0,FALSE

So a gamer and a non-gamer would for example have very different valuations for Nintendo or Capcom.

How? Game streaming. I have game pass ultimate from msft and they offer Xcloud. It's on phones, PC and consoles.  you only need a fast internet connection. There's no processing happening on your device it's all on their servers, you simply input your button commands, it goes to their servers, the game plays and displays back at you and you continue to play as if it's natively playing. 

I am really surprised how good the technology is today. If you don't believe me, just sign up for a game pass ultimate trial for 1 dollar and try it yourself. You will be shocked at how they have really turned gaming into their juggernaut and are leading the industry. Much ahead of Google stadia and GeForce Now. 

 It's super optimized and cheaper for them to have the processing units at their facilities than to R&D consoles, proto, market, build, sell, deal with shortages.

HSIDaoZMoqo,@ChengTeoh,2022-09-01T18:46:22Z,"You have to take into account that his analysis is very conservative.  You can use the software to plug in more rosier projections and it'll probably tell you that the price right now is a buy.  It all depends on the rate of return you are looking for.  If you want a 12.5% return of course the share price would need to be lower, but if you just want a 8% return then the share price would likely be closer to what the stock is at right now.  

If one estimates their FY 2023 earnings estimate to roughly $10.25 per share and apply a 20-21x multiple, a price target of $205 to $215 is what you get.  If you buy now you might get a 9% annual returns, but if you wait for it at $210ish you could get like 15% annually.  It's just a matter of what type of returns do you want.  Personally I'd start a small position when it hits anywhere near $240 and more if it goes to $200, then double the amount of shares if it actually reaches his price target.
