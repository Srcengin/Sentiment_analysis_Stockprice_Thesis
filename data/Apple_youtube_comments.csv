U6cAhJtsstk,@Wall2000x,2024-09-02T19:58:34Z,"Sell My Apple Stock To Buy Mutual Funds? WOW!  My first question: is Apple going to be around in 50 years?  Yes. Second question: what it will be worth in 50 years? It's difficult to predict what Apple will be worth in 50 years.  I suspect it will be worth 30x-40x what it is worth today.  By the way, how is Robert Morris doing right now?  Not good.  And he has no experience financial investment or economics. None. Considering that S&P mutuals are ladened with financials (the except is Bank of America), I'd stick with Apple.  I think you will see some short term dips but long term as strong a company. Don't judge investments by today or tomorrow but by the 25 year mark when you are closer to retirement.",0

U6cAhJtsstk,@georgeide2337,2024-06-29T22:33:03Z,"It depends on the cost basis he had when he purchased the stock. When Buffett purchased so much Apple stock, he did so at a bargain. Of course, that meant his total interest/profit was much higher and would therefore still ""lose"" money, but it was unrealized wealth and so of less consequence than if he had a larger cost basis.
If you buy 100 stocks at $1 and over 20 years those shares are worth $100 a share but crash before you can sell, you only lose $100. Someone who bought in at $50+ on the other hand would have lost $5000 plus their unrealized returns.


This is why single stocks are no longer a good bet for the average investor. There aren't many of these undervalued companies in this information age, so cost basis is more often than not very high. Back in the days of Buffett, he wasn't competing with the internet/institutions we are today, and he will be the first to admit that.",0

While apple only grow it by 4.5%, when pay out ratio is 15%; and they keep buying shares when the company is expensive.

I dont like that they keep buying shares on 200$ a share insted of giving investors higher dividend yield, i feel like apple do whats good for apple; not for the investor, atm.

This causes more people to lose money in the stock market than anything else.  At best, Apple is a big money safe haven as we head into recession.  Meaning, you will lose less money on Apple than other stocks or sectors.  Its the same reason why big money is pouring into utilities and consumer defensive.  Those sectors are going down from here, but they won't go down as much as other sectors.  Unlike the retail investor, they can't just get out of the market and go all cash.  They have to keep the vast majority in play at all times, and so you want the money in what will lose the least.  As I have said many times, if you saw the signs and heeded them you would have gone all cash at the end of 2021 with maybe the exception of energy.  This is not hindsight.  It was obvious.  The overall stock market including Apple is headed down from here.  $250 a share by end of 2022 is not going to happen.  You will be lucky if its $150 a share, and since Apple pays a crap dividend there really is no reason to hold other than for emotional reasons.  Which is fine.",0

Manufacturing earnings is a way of trading current value for future value. It‚Äôs a signal of confidence by the company. It‚Äôs not magic.
P/E valuation (pricing more accurately) doesn‚Äôt - at least not  directly - take into account the amount of cash the company holds or the debt the company owes.
A company can buy back shares and lower p/e funded by borrowed funds which can be a good strategy but needs further analysis. Obviously Appl has great future earnings potential that a share buy back is welcome!

Because of its rating and little volatility. If Apple ever falls, itll be an absolute disaster comparable to Meta or even worse. Im holding up to my position of now 7,1% (its gotten so big, because other stocks have fallen like 15-20%, while didnt really move since decemer), but i am not buying much more. One needs proper risk management. Of course this could heavily backfire in case Apple really announces a VR-Headset or even a self driving car.  But thats basically like buying Nintendo, because you hope they announce a new and better Switch model. Or buying Spotify bause you hope they get bought out. Ill stick to what i can predict. I mean, its buy & hold, not buy & hope :P BTW, I like the part where JC explains how a shrinking denominator in P/E gives a higher P/E-ratio.",2

The daily chart shows that the price has been consolidating extensively over the previous year. We are currently moving down towards the High band of this range, and there is a high chance that the price bounces and starts a short-term rally, also known as the ‚ÄúDead Cat Bounce‚Äù scenario. Enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions, I'd say that more emphasis should be put into tradng, since it is way profitable than hodling.

It is probably one of the most wanted companies to own in your portfolio, but at 3T mkt cap... let's be realistic dear investors. 8-10% revenue growth is far more optimistic.  Usually you guys are very conservative and I am a bit triggered by the low numbers for revenue growth but here I think you were a bit optimistic. I think if they do not increase prices, the next 2-3 years will see a stagnation. I sold Apple at 144 USD on average because i thought risk > return.

This name is unrivaled for reason that no other name has the ecosystem that AAPL has and control both hardware and software for such a large base.  Google only owns the operating systems.   Wall Street tried to understand the upgrade cycle but that is a silly exercise.  People will upgrade when they are ready to upgrade.  AAPL is a victim of its own success.  These phones work and work for a long time so they extends how long folks keep their iPhone.  As long as the base is getting bigger which it continues to do so, they will continue to sell phones.  All there iPhone owners become future customers for a Mac, iPad, watch, airpod and at least couple services.   Literally AAPL can split its business and the stock will jump cuz each business is an equivalent of a large cap business based on their revenue of that segment.

gqe_nMBTHSw,@GB-ws8zx,2021-12-11T16:25:08Z,"A very interesting vid.  Among the factors challenging my analysis, I'm not aware of any precedent for Apple's situation at greater than 2T (it's not about size alone, this type of company (with unique culture, brand and products/services) existing in this field), and the same questions you seem to ask: Could they grow more/how could they grow more? seem to be challenging certain assumptions/beliefs I hold.  I'm certain they are overvalued in the short term due to COVID/TINA, but, having studied Apple's unique philosophy for years, while numbers concern me, I have full confidence in the core culture that Jobs created, to both create and adapt.  Many can talk about trying to mimic Apple's approach, but I see few seeming to truly do it, or do it well.  For this reason, while I do think the current price is likely divorced from fundamentals, Apple's approach to creating a well-designed future (think both car and AR) really challenge my assumptions about what options exist once a company gets into the 2 - 3T range or beyond.  It's sheer size + geopolitical risks + transitioning to profits via services just raise A LOT of questions whose answers don't seem immediately clear.  Also, my guess: doubt along with the question of how could they grow more? weighs on the minds of many, and will require real evidence to resolve.",0

In NYC my career would have been WAAAAAAAY different had it been non-Union. A collective bargaining agreement ABSOLUTELY HELPS workers ESPECIALLY with companies like Amazon, Apple, and Starbucks. Heck. You might as well throw in Walmart.  They ALL have a convoluted idea of what a ‚Äúfair wage and benefits package‚Äù that usually has no basis in reality for the common hourly worker.

QkzrotUV9ek,@alejandrotopo,2021-11-23T01:48:35Z,"Excellente content guys as always regards from Monterrey, Mexico,  have 2 ideas for you, Maybe do a screening of several stocks maybe to show of 5-10-15 tickers you review just the 8 pillars (maybe going deep on some of them but very quickly), for example review the top 5 holding of the largest/most popular ETF (SOXL ""semiconductors"" , XRT ""retail"", TAN ""renewables"", ARKK ""cathy woods"") that last should be good haha, this way you guys could show how overvalued are some of this ETF given their components

And the second idea is do more of the stocks that are past their ""prime"", ""value"" stocks like KO, PEP,  XOM, KMI, JPM, this to show how even great stablish companies may not be good investments given that their growth its long gone or steady as they come limiting the outside potential.

Also, great job by the editing team.",1

QkzrotUV9ek,@MBarberfan4life,2021-11-23T00:29:46Z,"I don't like AAPL. Seems like the downside risk is huge: most of Apple's revenues come from iPhones. By the way, unit sales for the iPhone peaked several years ago, but Apple keeps raising the price. Not adding much value, don't ya think? I can get cheaper smartphones elsewhere. And, also, charging money for (non-scarce?) services isn't adding much value either when I can get similar services from Google for free (e.g. Youtube, Youtube Music, etc.)",0

YpLK8wqRA10,@m8lhed,2022-05-17T09:11:05Z,When we look at AAPL I believe rather than market share one should look at how much of the industry‚Äôs profit they grab. At one point they probably held 80% of the US smartphone profit even though they had only 50 % share and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs probably the case in smart watches / tablets etc. shorting Apple is not a slam dunk but neither is the upside potential unless you believe in the optionality,0
YpLK8wqRA10,@Lord_Falcon,2022-05-17T09:10:27Z,"I've never understood why most people buy Apple products. I suppose there's the brand factor because people think it's American & luxury/high quality but anyone that has common sense shouldn't buy them. Why? 
1) They're extremely expensive. Considering most people in the US have less than $1000 in savings it's insane for people to buy them or get them on expensive contacts.
2) Quality is poor for the price which is intentional to force people into expensive repairs or just buying a new device.
3) Apple constantly pisses people off by changing ports to force buying new accessories with every device.
4) They routinely makes older devices worse via software updates to force you into replacing.
5) They often reduce functionality of apps that provide competing services to their own in an attempt to force you to use theirs even if it sucks (which it often does). E.g. Apple Music vs Spotify.
As an investment prospect I don't like Apple partly because of the reasons above but mainly because they have failed to build the brand hype outside the US. There's a few European countries with strong sales but it's not at all like the US.  They have about 50% US market share but to maintain this they've had to release cheaper models in recent years. This hurts their ""luxury"" brand image. They're stuck between a rock & a hard place. Either de-value the brand with affordable products and become just another ordinary smartphone maker or stay really expensive and eventualy become a niche high priced brand. But then the products have to get better which will reduce margins.",4

At any point investors can decide that your growth is done and lower your valuation to under your revenue and there is nothing an investor can do but accept it and move their money out. I remember when WMT was a growth company with a higher valuation than its revenue. WMT was the company making millionaires like MSFT and AAPL. Now it's a stodgy old brick and mortar retailer with a valuation lower than its revenue like many energy companies. Valuation is a fickle indicator with no hard and fast rule to calculate what it should be.,4

UlvCS9w-08I,@Defomir,2022-09-12T20:28:01Z,"Oh god, IMHO you are not getting the point about innovation and Apple. Their products didn't change in last 3 years. iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 are the same phones (with 2gb rams added to newer one). And across the World prices are higher than Android counterparts (fun fact, you have to pay 849 GBP for basic version of iPhone 14, when in US it cost 799 USD, check GBPUSD value - atm for one GBP  you get 1.17 USD). They skyrocket prices outside US, with no new value added to product, and they event 'adjusted' prices up of old devices (like iPhone 13 or Macbook Air M1), because of inflation (and the prices of new devices wont be looking so scary). Well because of that inflation less people will be changing their devices to new ones - they have to pay more for same stuff, so why change? I'm currently sitting on iPhone X, and wanted to change for 13 or 14 depending on whats new in 14. Guess I won't be changing at all with this price policy, I can wait another year for iPhone 15. Share buybacks are awesome, I agree, but they are awesome when you buy your shares CHEAP, not on 25-35 PE. That's actually waste of shareholders money. Yeah, I know they have like 200 billions so they have to do something with the money. Maybe innovative products? ;-) I agree on software and services stuff. Issue is - if you don't sale phones and users are leaving, then to who you will sell services? Check the iPhone sells - from 2015 it stagnated. And that's the issue with Apple that investors have right now. Money part is a check - for now, but it can be whole different story in a year from now.",0

Worth noting that I work for a company that is the largest corporation in an industry that manufactures a product that all other industries have demand for.  My point? Whatever happens in our industry happens to the markets at large 3-6 months later. 

Our orders have cratered. Need to be thinking of a correction (from end of July) in the range of 25-75% drop, depending on your industry, customer base and inventory levels. 

FWIW, we blew past a 25% correction in my industry back in August.

Plus inflation of everything else in our lives makes it a hard sale. I love iphones and apple products but this years iPhone wasn't really in upgrade. It's biggest feature was software based. Dynamic island and always on display isn't an upgrade. And the 48 mega pixel camera that bins down to 12 mega pixel like every iPhone sense iPhone 6s is marketing ploy. Anyways. I like my 13 pro max.

2j50UWYRefg,@davidpaterson7142,2022-01-28T20:24:00Z,"Nice analysis - however one point I disagree on is your opinion that Apple should increase their dividend or issue a special dividend. It is worth noting that dividends are taxed heavily and so it makes much more sense for the company to use any additional funds for further buybacks. If an investor needs income then they can simply sell some of their shares, and any capital gain will be far more tax advantageous than receiving a dividend. Not to mention the benefit of allowing the investor to choose when they do and don't get taxed on this gain. As you even mention yourself, that most investors would probably take the dividend and simply reinvest in the company, this would be a completely unnecessary loss of capital due to the tax deduction, plus any additional dealing costs.

In addition to the above, buybacks also help to reduce volatility in the stock which is an added benefit for investors. When the markets are taking a dive there is great comfort in knowing the company is continuing the buyback its own shares providing support to the price.",2

Apple is a good business but perhaps at its apex. The last two years as you mentioned were phenomenal but one has to wonder how much the stimulus played a part.

    Apple hasn't had much user growth if any at all over the last 2-4 years.Their profits are from charging higher prices to  a saturating consumer base. While this applies specifically to the iphone, its still their biggest money maker and its fair to assume no other product will have the iphone's user base. Apple is too reliant on Foxconn, TSMC, and Samsung to manufacture their products and AWS to host their services. This is not a business that is in the top echelons of tech.

Analysts are quite pessimistic about Apple growth (2.55% in 2022), (3.69% in 2023) and (3.69% in 2024) and if you project 10% until 2027 then you get 7.45% growth, at 15PE a negative growth (-4% to a stock price at $129 in 2027. Of course at the current P/E of 30 you get a better result with a return of 8%.

And  of the software bought, Apple of course takes its own commission fee. So Apple makes money off their devices in two ways, both selling them and from their usage.",2

c3RYivReVrU,@janracek4445,2022-02-05T16:01:55Z,"Hi Sven, I have a question. In your overview now I can see FB Meta 10 % return 205 dollars. In your video in September, there is 413 dollars for 10 % return. Quite a difference, is not it? Since it is only about 5 months ago, it makes me wonder what changed. Does really one miss in quarter earnings have such a huge influence on the overall return, when it is fast growing company with almost no debt? Everybody is so used to that Meta had no or little competition that everybody is very shocked that Meta has to compete with anybody, what a suprise. Is not exactly the stance of value investor to remove the Wall Street noise and know that when a well established company misses one quarter earnings, with 37 % growth of revenue in comparison to 2020, with 36 % growth in EPS in comparison to 2020, there is not a reason to decrease your expected valuation 50 %? At least this is what I learned from your videos and it made me wonder how much is your stance now different from Wall Street analysts and short-term focused investors (speculators). The valuation of 205 dollars price per a common stock for 10 % return seems a rather very very conservative and strange in comparison to 413 dollars published 5 months ago.  
Best regards",25

The only problem with a model that assumes a fixed growth rate for 10 years is that. Maybe a better way to read it is: Apple needs to achieve a x% growth rate for the next 10 years to justify its current price. The big question is if you have faith in the leadership to find new areas that innovation can occur and keep the growth going, in the face of competition. As warren Buffet put it: investors invest to make money. Not many people invest just for the prestige. So even the largest, best run company, if not growing, must compensate investors in some other way.",0

I just can't understand the assumption that a company with a very low P/E ratio like 6 or 7, will eventually have a higher one.
Is it not possible for a company to continue growing its revenues but the P/E stays at those low levels??
Im asking because if we change the assumptions of the P/E from 12 to 20 (which you use most of the time) to 7-8-9 for example, the prices we get at the analyze tool are way lower.
And i checked a lot of companies with very good growth, no liabilites, no share dilution etc etc but their P/E was very low.
How can we be sure that in the future it will be higher and this will drive the stock price at higher levels?
Because at the end of the day, the price of any stock goes up or down based on the demand.
I know its a stupid question, but its changing almost everything on my analysis while im trying to have a more realistic assumptions.

0vQX9UOQxio,@DhavalBrahmbhatt2627,2021-10-30T16:17:49Z,"Constructive feedback: Your PE multiple being lower than 22 method is not correct. In your videos about the smallest companies to the biggest one, you apply the same PE expectations. In your own words, you say that the validation defers from company to company depending on what they do. In your own words, you say that large companies can‚Äôt grow as quickly as smaller companies. Still you apply the same PE to both. So the PE needs to be dependent on how large the company is or the % of TAM they have covered. Work out a formula and that will make more sense than a fixed figure to apply across the board.

Mo saying Amazon sells EVERYthing and they will do 111bn vs Apple only seelling iDevices and they will still do 89bn. Complete wrong comparison. Amazon is broker, they only take commission on any item they sell depends on the price of the item and is not in their own hands. Apple makes stuff themselves and hence it is completely down to them how much margin they wanna make. Add to the fact that Apple‚Äôs stuff is way overpriced (surely you guys know about things being overpriced). So on fair value basis, their revenue would be more like 50 to 60bn. The reason they make 89bn is because they are greedy as hell and they have the right to sell it whatever price they want because ppl buy it for the  brand name. 

So if we consider all that together, it isn‚Äôt really that incredible. What is incredible is that it is actually happening whether I like it or not but if you really apply your logic of fair value, it isn‚Äôt. 

Love their produces when assessed objectively on their merits (except price) but hate the company.",4

Because its such a good company demand is increased above what the company is actually worth making it more prone price inflation (though it is at least based on real cash flow). Apple has been a great company for a long time, so you can assume that when you bought the stock you paid a premium for the promising potential it held then. Obviously, all this aside, it is still best to buy companies like apple that perform well, but my point is they are not invisible.

Apple and the stock market overall is way over bought right now (on a short-term basis). It is more than likely that the market will experience a 5 to 10% pullback. For a long-term investor this means nothing, and you should continue to hold. Also, if we weren‚Äôt in a rising interest rate environment, I would say that Apple and the stock market could continue to stay at elevated levels. The thing is though, when rates are rising, price tends to intersect with value, and if you take a quick look at Apple‚Äòs price to earnings or sales ratios, you will see that Apple is trading at a 20 to 30% premium to the HIGH-end of it‚Äôs historical norm.",0

Apple will be facing an uphill challenge not to increase their earnings, but not to decline (Apple is already declining in their earnings if their  growth is in single digits as just by keeping with inflation grants you up to double digits of growth).

When market wakes up to this fact, Apple is going down. It is already over-valued as he had shown compared to all other great companies. There is no demand for its stock as Apple and likes of Buffet are its real customers. However, sooner or later, whales won't be able to support Apple's price and then the real demand will push stock price down.",0

Surely this yield will increase with time with the new purchases you will make from time to time. Moreover, I think you skip very good stocks that give good dividends in a long term.

1. He makes no statement regarding his interest or benefit in providing this view. Did he just short the stock or buy puts? The more people sell the more he might be profiting. He provided no information on his portfolio. Possible market manipulation?
2. I like his highly technical wording  such as ""Un-Natural"". Obviously extremely subjective wording instead of objective. Need to pull out my cross and holy water instead of logic, statistics,  and reasoning. 
3. He is missing his full legal name and home address so all the people who sell the stock and that losses money on his analysis can sue him for damages.
4. Would be great to see a followup video a month from now to see how accurate his advice is.

Lastly, yes there is a greater probability that the stock will correct but one must take into consideration making a type II error.",0

Adding to your position on engulfing candle sticks for day trades is more akin to chasing a move rather than adding on conviction. That's a real dangerous play because you leave yourself no room for a stop loss on a sudden move to the upside. You want to add to a position when the short term trend is moving in the opposite direction of what you want, but the overall larger trend is still in your favor. This example here was lucky with engulfing all the way down, but this type of move is definitely an exception, not the rule.",1

I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85% during the ensuing 4 year bear market.  I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do.  I wish I had bought more.  I am in profit for now but I am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from Michael Wei I have learned from you and other Youtubrs  especially my mentor Williams Frederick who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 3.9 to 12btc that no one really knows what is going to happen in the market.buffering",32

That way you can tell if the stock is currently over or undervalued based on where it historically trades at.  The highs of COVID bring the 5 year average up but we are now in a completely different market.  Curious on your thoughts.  Keep up the good stuff though.üëç,2

Answer ~ 'In 2021, Taiwan won 26 per cent of the world's semiconductor revenue, and accounted for 64 per cent of foundry revenue. In 2022, TransForce predicts the global foundry market to increase by 20 per cent, to $128.7 billion, and Taiwan's share of that revenue will increase two points.' @Brother Grace ~ Now just like yourself, I also am not a conspiracy theorist. However, 'What-If' Taiwan's semiconductor distribution capabilities were disrupted by China in retaliation to this Chinese unsanctioned visit by Nancy Pelosi? And more importantly what do you think it will do to her NVIDA stock price if the world would then have to look for other means to make up for those 20 plus % production in semiconductors that will no longer be coming out of Taiwan? I would use the word shady but I think it falls short in description. Food for thought. Stay Blessed.",3

When he does the stock analyzer, and its the stock currently has a PE of 30, he does a PE of 13 15 17 in the stock analyzer tool. This doesn't seem logical at the disconnect between what you are looking for in the 8 pillar, current PE, and how drastically Paul reduces the PE of the stock and says its undervalued. I do agree its over priced, but what I disagree on is how over priced it is. Can you explain why he is drastically reducing the PE of the stock when we know that Microsoft most likely won't drop to a 17 PE anytime soon.",4

bft24X7auA8,@travelinggirl8257,2023-12-29T20:13:41Z,"I remember watching a video and so annoyed I can't remember enough to find it again but Warren Buffet flat out said that he wouldn't have bought Apple because he believed in sticking with his core competencies and he didn't understand tech at the time (and maybe still doesn't really) but he said that one of his younger staff really talked up Apple and I got the impression that he gave the ok to go ahead and try it and then he realized how terrific it was and then he bought a lot more and has loved it since. I do not know why he would not give the person full credit for talking him into it and leading him into the tech world that made him such a substantial amount of money. Seems kind of small to me but maybe he's afraid of losing the person if everyone knows how fantastic a move he made- hard ot know. That person certainly deserves the credit. If it was Ted W., I'm glad you're giving him more of a spotlight. At least Buffet admitted that it was either him or the other staff member. That narrows it down to 2 anyway. :)",0

bft24X7auA8,@Bosshog-WealthHealthBetterment,2022-07-09T20:39:47Z,"Let's be honest, Holmes got a softer sentence because she's female. The sentencing disparity between men and women runs at > 3x the difference between black and white, yet the former is ignored and the latter is held up as a sign of systemic racism. Both the UK and US publish numbers of the subject and see similar ratios. 

In summary, women are seen as being less capable of being devious so when a men is involved they are seen as followers (this was a key argument from Holmes' defence) and they are also more likely to have mitigating circumstances because they look after the elderly and kids at a higher proportion. Not saying either of those reasons are ""fair"" on women, but we shouldn't ignore what is a clear difference in sentencing purely based on gender. 

Arguably, the most important area of all where equality matters is before the law, and I don't see that at all. Whether you're a Classical Liberal (so right leaning) caring about equality of opportunity, of or a Progressive Liberal (so left leaning) caring about equality of outcome, the whole situation should leave a very poor taste in the mouth. 

Holmes should absolutely have been found similarly guilty. That would be equality worth fighting for.",1

We shouldn't so rigidly focus on the valuation, in some cases such as Buffett's Apple decision, and your CP decision, qualitative aspects such as duration moats will weigh more in decision making.  As Buffett said: it's better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price, than a fair business at a wonderful price.  A practical way to approach this point is this: given two businesses with similar valuations,  we accept a smaller margin of safety (in %) for the business with a more durable moat and vice versa.",1

sCAVYjR7sd0,@traumflug,2023-05-11T11:20:24Z,"Nice video. These considerations on how to deal with AAPL options is kind of a reversed sunk cost fallacy, though. Just like one shouldn't look at money already lost when planning on how to proceed, one also shouldn't look at money already earned. If these options are 106% up now and you decide something which reduces this to 80% up, you didn't gain 80%, but lost 25%, it was a bad decision. When doing decisions, one should always look at the situation right at that moment, and on how it might develop from there. Earlier gains don't matter.",1

I realize this strategy would depend a lot on how the stocks moves going into earnings. What I am curious about is if you bought options that expired after earnings on every single company that had earnings from 1 weak - 1 month would it be similar to just buying SPY + an extra 1% or 2% a month, or would theta wipe out all possible gains.",1

0vQX9UOQxio,@DhavalBrahmbhatt2627,2021-10-30T16:17:49Z,"Constructive feedback: Your PE multiple being lower than 22 method is not correct. In your videos about the smallest companies to the biggest one, you apply the same PE expectations. In your own words, you say that the validation defers from company to company depending on what they do. In your own words, you say that large companies can‚Äôt grow as quickly as smaller companies. Still you apply the same PE to both. So the PE needs to be dependent on how large the company is or the % of TAM they have covered. Work out a formula and that will make more sense than a fixed figure to apply across the board.

Mo saying Amazon sells EVERYthing and they will do 111bn vs Apple only seelling iDevices and they will still do 89bn. Complete wrong comparison. Amazon is broker, they only take commission on any item they sell depends on the price of the item and is not in their own hands. Apple makes stuff themselves and hence it is completely down to them how much margin they wanna make. Add to the fact that Apple‚Äôs stuff is way overpriced (surely you guys know about things being overpriced). So on fair value basis, their revenue would be more like 50 to 60bn. The reason they make 89bn is because they are greedy as hell and they have the right to sell it whatever price they want because ppl buy it for the  brand name. 

So if we consider all that together, it isn‚Äôt really that incredible. What is incredible is that it is actually happening whether I like it or not but if you really apply your logic of fair value, it isn‚Äôt. 

Love their produces when assessed objectively on their merits (except price) but hate the company.",4

This name is unrivaled for reason that no other name has the ecosystem that AAPL has and control both hardware and software for such a large base.  Google only owns the operating systems.   Wall Street tried to understand the upgrade cycle but that is a silly exercise.  People will upgrade when they are ready to upgrade.  AAPL is a victim of its own success.  These phones work and work for a long time so they extends how long folks keep their iPhone.  As long as the base is getting bigger which it continues to do so, they will continue to sell phones.  All there iPhone owners become future customers for a Mac, iPad, watch, airpod and at least couple services.   Literally AAPL can split its business and the stock will jump cuz each business is an equivalent of a large cap business based on their revenue of that segment.

I'm certain they are overvalued in the short term due to COVID/TINA, but, having studied Apple's unique philosophy for years, while numbers concern me, I have full confidence in the core culture that Jobs created, to both create and adapt.  Many can talk about trying to mimic Apple's approach, but I see few seeming to truly do it, or do it well.  For this reason, while I do think the current price is likely divorced from fundamentals, Apple's approach to creating a well-designed future (think both car and AR) really challenge my assumptions about what options exist once a company gets into the 2 - 3T range or beyond.  It's sheer size + geopolitical risks + transitioning to profits via services just raise A LOT of questions whose answers don't seem immediately clear.  Also, my guess: doubt along with the question of how could they grow more? weighs on the minds of many, and will require real evidence to resolve.",0

Most newbie‚Äôs investors often undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis with regards to trading bitcoin. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market. Essentially, the process involves studying the paths of a particular asset movement in the past so as to establish a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movements. I would encourage investors to trade as we have been doing with Mr Albert Johnson since the last bear market, increasing my portfolio daily.",15

And the second idea is do more of the stocks that are past their ""prime"", ""value"" stocks like KO, PEP,  XOM, KMI, JPM, this to show how even great stablish companies may not be good investments given that their growth its long gone or steady as they come limiting the outside potential.

The Jan 2024  LEAPS 150 call trades about half the volume of the 2023, so it's reasonable volume.  Also, if concerned about thin trading, just use a limit order to ensure you get a reasonable price.

Amazon has a HUGE problem with knock-offs being mixed in with their genuine product inventory and Amazon sending fakes by accident when you've paid top dollar for the real thing.

Now I prefer to go to apple directly so I can trust what I'm buying is a real.

r7tkFMvqmms,@kylerear629,2022-05-10T23:51:50Z,"Watch your analysis‚Äô several times every day. Thank you. The more I think about the current situation the more I am convinced we are moving to a different type of ""globalization"". The capitulation in prior cycles was during the bear cycle in which a new bull cycle followed. You are assuming that this drop was during a bear cycle and the peak in November of 2021 was not a subpeak but THE peak. I believe it was a subpeak and that's why the drop was not as severe as the 92%, 85% and 84% respectively, NOT because more people are holding and refusing to sell. Further, it's illogical to say the capitulation during the current bear cycle (which I do not believe we are in) is not as severe as it used to be when the last capitulation during al bear cycle  we had was 84% just one point shy of the bear cycle prior to that which was 85%. So by your logic, time has shown us that the history of bear cycle capitulations are less severe over time  bc more people are holding? Going from 85% capitulation to 84%?  Now this bear cycle all of a sudden is 54%? Highly doubtful. This was a MASSIVE correction, not a bear cycle capitulation. I still believe we are in a bull cycle and the final peak has yet to come. My distinctive enlightenment is for you to get into crypto market if you haven't early on. I <maintain its going to skyrocket soon.

YpLK8wqRA10,@Lord_Falcon,2022-05-17T09:10:27Z,"I've never understood why most people buy Apple products. I suppose there's the brand factor because people think it's American & luxury/high quality but anyone that has common sense shouldn't buy them. Why? 
1) They're extremely expensive. Considering most people in the US have less than $1000 in savings it's insane for people to buy them or get them on expensive contacts.
2) Quality is poor for the price which is intentional to force people into expensive repairs or just buying a new device.
3) Apple constantly pisses people off by changing ports to force buying new accessories with every device.
4) They routinely makes older devices worse via software updates to force you into replacing.
5) They often reduce functionality of apps that provide competing services to their own in an attempt to force you to use theirs even if it sucks (which it often does). E.g. Apple Music vs Spotify.
As an investment prospect I don't like Apple partly because of the reasons above but mainly because they have failed to build the brand hype outside the US. There's a few European countries with strong sales but it's not at all like the US.  They have about 50% US market share but to maintain this they've had to release cheaper models in recent years. This hurts their ""luxury"" brand image. They're stuck between a rock & a hard place. Either de-value the brand with affordable products and become just another ordinary smartphone maker or stay really expensive and eventualy become a niche high priced brand. But then the products have to get better which will reduce margins.",4

Either they go dovish and we go into recession due to hyper inflation or they remain hawkish and they throw us into recession to stop inflation.  Either way, the outcome is likely the same.  Markets reaction to Wednesday will likely set the tone the rest of the month.  Also keep in mind that the Fed was there in 2020 and 2018 to prop the market up.  With all that is going on in the economy, I don‚Äôt think they can run to the rescue this time.  Market has also yet to price in earnings projection reductions due a slowing economy.  I think you will see that with earnings reports this quarter.  Stimulus is gone, inflation is creating havoc, and interest rates are going up etc.",1

POSgtYQlnBo,@eddierazak,2022-01-24T14:21:16Z,"Hi Ziet, great channel!
Maybe you can do a video about capital gains tax.

Many people don't know that we (non-US residents) have an advantage over people in the US when it comes to investing. US citizens and residents are subject to capital gains tax on US stocks. For non-US residents there is no capital gains tax.

So for Malaysians and Singaporeans for example, if your Tesla stock goes up, you make all of the upside when you sell, whereas US residents lose some of that gain to tax.

However, there is still tax on dividends of US stocks, which applies to everyone. So, it may be better to maximise the gains from stocks that don't pay dividends, like Tesla, instead of stocks like Apple, where you lose some dividends to tax.",1

sx1pSCVjivM,@gregdonald202,2022-04-19T06:29:38Z,"ytytI'm a skeptic, <-yet I'm familiar with a lot of elements of BTC. So, let's get a few things straight: BTC is an investment asset - it's scarce, like gold, but it's easier to obtain, and large firms like PayPal and Grayscale, as well as a slew of banks, hedge funds, and ordinary people, own it. Whales with self-hosted bitcoin wallets have a hard time selling it without going through KYC, which can be financially disastrous in some situations. People lose access to their bitcoin wallets, causing their bitcoin to be frozen indefinitely. The hype and fear of missing out (FOMO) are on the rise, and most individuals merely buy and hodl bitcoin. You must realize that traditional stock market fundamentals do not apply. BTC may become even more desirable as a result of the new regulations (although have a minus). Basically, anything that could prevent bitcoin from mooning, in my opinion, would be strict regulation and greater investment options uncovered by bitcoin owners. However, it is recommended that you develop a workable strategy/daily signals in order to build and expand a robust portfolio in the future. Despite the recent volatility, I have been trading using Mr Mike Hart daily signals and method. His direction makes trading less stressful and more profitable. With Mike Hart  daily indications, I was able to easily expand my portfolio from 0.5 BTC to 7.2 BTC in just 4 weeks of trading. His daily signals are extremely precise, resulting in a high positive return on investment and is willing to help anyone who is interested in crypto trading; you can reach him on Telegram (  @Miketrade70 ) (no additional digits or letters) for questions and effective trading techniques.learninglearning",0

sx1pSCVjivM,@gregdonald202,2022-04-19T06:29:38Z,"ytytI'm a skeptic, <-yet I'm familiar with a lot of elements of BTC. So, let's get a few things straight: BTC is an investment asset - it's scarce, like gold, but it's easier to obtain, and large firms like PayPal and Grayscale, as well as a slew of banks, hedge funds, and ordinary people, own it. Whales with self-hosted bitcoin wallets have a hard time selling it without going through KYC, which can be financially disastrous in some situations. People lose access to their bitcoin wallets, causing their bitcoin to be frozen indefinitely. The hype and fear of missing out (FOMO) are on the rise, and most individuals merely buy and hodl bitcoin. You must realize that traditional stock market fundamentals do not apply. BTC may become even more desirable as a result of the new regulations (although have a minus). Basically, anything that could prevent bitcoin from mooning, in my opinion, would be strict regulation and greater investment options uncovered by bitcoin owners. However, it is recommended that you develop a workable strategy/daily signals in order to build and expand a robust portfolio in the future. Despite the recent volatility, I have been trading using Mr Mike Hart daily signals and method. His direction makes trading less stressful and more profitable. With Mike Hart  daily indications, I was able to easily expand my portfolio from 0.5 BTC to 7.2 BTC in just 4 weeks of trading. His daily signals are extremely precise, resulting in a high positive return on investment and is willing to help anyone who is interested in crypto trading; you can reach him on Telegram (  @Miketrade70 ) (no additional digits or letters) for questions and effective trading techniques.learninglearning",0

2j50UWYRefg,@davidpaterson7142,2022-01-28T20:24:00Z,"Nice analysis - however one point I disagree on is your opinion that Apple should increase their dividend or issue a special dividend. It is worth noting that dividends are taxed heavily and so it makes much more sense for the company to use any additional funds for further buybacks. If an investor needs income then they can simply sell some of their shares, and any capital gain will be far more tax advantageous than receiving a dividend. Not to mention the benefit of allowing the investor to choose when they do and don't get taxed on this gain. As you even mention yourself, that most investors would probably take the dividend and simply reinvest in the company, this would be a completely unnecessary loss of capital due to the tax deduction, plus any additional dealing costs.

In addition to the above, buybacks also help to reduce volatility in the stock which is an added benefit for investors. When the markets are taking a dive there is great comfort in knowing the company is continuing the buyback its own shares providing support to the price.",2

sx1pSCVjivM,@gregdonald202,2022-04-19T06:29:38Z,"ytytI'm a skeptic, <-yet I'm familiar with a lot of elements of BTC. So, let's get a few things straight: BTC is an investment asset - it's scarce, like gold, but it's easier to obtain, and large firms like PayPal and Grayscale, as well as a slew of banks, hedge funds, and ordinary people, own it. Whales with self-hosted bitcoin wallets have a hard time selling it without going through KYC, which can be financially disastrous in some situations. People lose access to their bitcoin wallets, causing their bitcoin to be frozen indefinitely. The hype and fear of missing out (FOMO) are on the rise, and most individuals merely buy and hodl bitcoin. You must realize that traditional stock market fundamentals do not apply. BTC may become even more desirable as a result of the new regulations (although have a minus). Basically, anything that could prevent bitcoin from mooning, in my opinion, would be strict regulation and greater investment options uncovered by bitcoin owners. However, it is recommended that you develop a workable strategy/daily signals in order to build and expand a robust portfolio in the future.

9jklMFaUzWw,@grahamoldfield3474,2022-06-15T01:13:08Z,"AAPL sales were "" brought forward"" because of work from home ,so computer and to a lesser extent phone upgrades occurred . Sales and revenue are highly dependant on phone replacement sale . As the recession gets worse and unemployment grows , inflation of food , petrol , home ;loans a new phone is far from peoples thought . AAPL had a PE ratio of around 28 when it was about 180  . I remember when AAPl had a PE of 7 !  . AAPL is down about 27% . The recession is here and companies will revise their earnings down , which increases the PE ratio , so the market drops the price . AAPl has had in the past several 40 plus % drops ,why do you think ""its different this time "". You haven't seen recessions when you were old enough to see how bad thing get and how long it lasts , let alone what we face now . In other recession they could lower interest rates to stimulate the economy , use QE , job stimulus programs etc . This time they can not , and in fact they are doing the exact opposite with Quantative tightening at a faster rate that they said earlier this year !!  Inflation is probably 15% as they generally exclude Food and fuel .Please become ""situationally aware "" , numbers and charts are great ,but if you see a tidal wave coming do not ignore what you eyes can see . Europe and the rest of the world will soon see a huge shortage of Grains , Fertilizer has been in short supply so a lot of planting hasn't occurred and crop yields will be a lot less . Grain shortage affects meat and just about all food produced . In January the sanction on Russian oil really start and in a few months Russia will probably cut off  62% of GAs that Germany uses .",2

Adding to your position on engulfing candle sticks for day trades is more akin to chasing a move rather than adding on conviction. That's a real dangerous play because you leave yourself no room for a stop loss on a sudden move to the upside. You want to add to a position when the short term trend is moving in the opposite direction of what you want, but the overall larger trend is still in your favor. This example here was lucky with engulfing all the way down, but this type of move is definitely an exception, not the rule.",1

Of course, that meant his total interest/profit was much higher and would therefore still ""lose"" money, but it was unrealized wealth and so of less consequence than if he had a larger cost basis.
If you buy 100 stocks at $1 and over 20 years those shares are worth $100 a share but crash before you can sell, you only lose $100. Someone who bought in at $50+ on the other hand would have lost $5000 plus their unrealized returns.


This is why single stocks are no longer a good bet for the average investor. There aren't many of these undervalued companies in this information age, so cost basis is more often than not very high.

I'm still very bearish, but daily RSI shows that we still in a range between 4100 and 4200 (it's a ligth ascending channel) and that we will bounce again to 4200. RSI daily of Apple shows the same. Apple will bounce to 153 on monday and close at 152. But on tuesday we migth have a big day down and the week should end very bearish. RSI daily and weekly shows bouce for Tesla.... So finally i am not sure the the weekly. The best to do is to wait and see how the market react at the boundaries of the range/ascending channel : if we breakout the 4200, then we should go higher, if we breakdown 4090 then we should go lower. But for monday i'm pretty sure, we will go higher (4200 or maybe lower at the middle of the range) unless we break 4090 directly.",2

At any point investors can decide that your growth is done and lower your valuation to under your revenue and there is nothing an investor can do but accept it and move their money out. I remember when WMT was a growth company with a higher valuation than its revenue. WMT was the company making millionaires like MSFT and AAPL. Now it's a stodgy old brick and mortar retailer with a valuation lower than its revenue like many energy companies. Valuation is a fickle indicator with no hard and fast rule to calculate what it should be.,4

UlvCS9w-08I,@Defomir,2022-09-12T20:28:01Z,"Oh god, IMHO you are not getting the point about innovation and Apple. Their products didn't change in last 3 years. iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 are the same phones (with 2gb rams added to newer one). And across the World prices are higher than Android counterparts (fun fact, you have to pay 849 GBP for basic version of iPhone 14, when in US it cost 799 USD, check GBPUSD value - atm for one GBP  you get 1.17 USD). They skyrocket prices outside US, with no new value added to product, and they event 'adjusted' prices up of old devices (like iPhone 13 or Macbook Air M1), because of inflation (and the prices of new devices wont be looking so scary). Well because of that inflation less people will be changing their devices to new ones - they have to pay more for same stuff, so why change? I'm currently sitting on iPhone X, and wanted to change for 13 or 14 depending on whats new in 14. Guess I won't be changing at all with this price policy, I can wait another year for iPhone 15. Share buybacks are awesome, I agree, but they are awesome when you buy your shares CHEAP, not on 25-35 PE. That's actually waste of shareholders money. Yeah, I know they have like 200 billions so they have to do something with the money. Maybe innovative products? ;-) I agree on software and services stuff. Issue is - if you don't sale phones and users are leaving, then to who you will sell services? Check the iPhone sells - from 2015 it stagnated. And that's the issue with Apple that investors have right now. Money part is a check - for now, but it can be whole different story in a year from now.",0

K9m96aae4w4,@chrono9428,2022-10-01T08:49:39Z,"An economy cannot keep buying and spending, it is unsustainable.  The period of unbridled buying and spending began before 2008-2009, after that, with QE, this behaviour became entrenched. With QT and inflation above 3%, it will possibly change this behaviour.  It is also good for the environment.  We consume less and focus more on recycling or prolonging the lifespan of our consumables.  I am happily using a iPhone6, and finding ways to repurpose my iphone5.  I hope the economy will now move back to less consumerism and more savings for the long run.  Maybe it is bad for many of the stocks, with much less earnings, but it would be good for the world over the long term.",0

Wall Street tried to understand the upgrade cycle but that is a silly exercise.  People will upgrade when they are ready to upgrade.  AAPL is a victim of its own success.  These phones work and work for a long time so they extends how long folks keep their iPhone.  As long as the base is getting bigger which it continues to do so, they will continue to sell phones.  All there iPhone owners become future customers for a Mac, iPad, watch, airpod and at least couple services.   Literally AAPL can split its business and the stock will jump cuz each business is an equivalent of a large cap business based on their revenue of that segment.

Among the factors challenging my analysis, I'm not aware of any precedent for Apple's situation at greater than 2T (it's not about size alone, this type of company (with unique culture, brand and products/services) existing in this field), and the same questions you seem to ask: Could they grow more/how could they grow more? seem to be challenging certain assumptions/beliefs I hold.  I'm certain they are overvalued in the short term due to COVID/TINA, but, having studied Apple's unique philosophy for years, while numbers concern me, I have full confidence in the core culture that Jobs created, to both create and adapt.  Many can talk about trying to mimic Apple's approach, but I see few seeming to truly do it, or do it well.  For this reason, while I do think the current price is likely divorced from fundamentals, Apple's approach to creating a well-designed future (think both car and AR) really challenge my assumptions about what options exist once a company gets into the 2 - 3T range or beyond.  It's sheer size + geopolitical risks + transitioning to profits via services just raise A LOT of questions whose answers don't seem immediately clear.  Also, my guess: doubt along with the question of how could they grow more? weighs on the minds of many, and will require real evidence to resolve.",0

That said I want to challenge the idea that your dollars have no political or social consequence. When we invest we're rewarding companies and their business. If a company has clearly exploitative practices or environmental impacts, and everyone decides not to support it, it suddenly becomes a bad investment. The company will never get the funds or support in the stock market.

That is just how aged leather looks after long usage. Maybe if you have a full black leather casing that might cover up the aging. It's actually what people who loves leather prefer. It gives it characteristics. I know this because I make custom leather wallets with veg-tan leather.",0

mzHTLTiQezE,@goldenremnant2610,2022-09-28T11:59:36Z,"Yes, we‚Äôre seeing the same exact thing in my industry - a massive, sweeping drop in orders because inventories are already way too high because no one is buying anything right now when their utilities bill is $500/month instead of what it used to be ($175-225), and when energy prices in general are still way too high and inflation is slapping us in the face every month with a 2-4% added premium. 

Worth noting that I work for a company that is the largest corporation in an industry that manufactures a product that all other industries have demand for.  My point? Whatever happens in our industry happens to the markets at large 3-6 months later. 

Our orders have cratered. Need to be thinking of a correction (from end of July) in the range of 25-75% drop, depending on your industry, customer base and inventory levels. 

FWIW, we blew past a 25% correction in my industry back in August.

Plus inflation of everything else in our lives makes it a hard sale. I love iphones and apple products but this years iPhone wasn't really in upgrade. It's biggest feature was software based. Dynamic island and always on display isn't an upgrade. And the 48 mega pixel camera that bins down to 12 mega pixel like every iPhone sense iPhone 6s is marketing ploy. Anyways. I like my 13 pro max.

I would say it's right to just sit and wait, maybe take a few losses, that's a bad attitude for the investor because as an investor who's always finding ways to multiply and stack more and more coins and make a profit , should it be the right way of life, even experienced traders have doubts about whether to go long or short.

In your videos about the smallest companies to the biggest one, you apply the same PE expectations. In your own words, you say that the validation defers from company to company depending on what they do. In your own words, you say that large companies can‚Äôt grow as quickly as smaller companies. Still you apply the same PE to both. So the PE needs to be dependent on how large the company is or the % of TAM they have covered. Work out a formula and that will make more sense than a fixed figure to apply across the board.

Mo saying Amazon sells EVERYthing and they will do 111bn vs Apple only seelling iDevices and they will still do 89bn. Complete wrong comparison. Amazon is broker, they only take commission on any item they sell depends on the price of the item and is not in their own hands. Apple makes stuff themselves and hence it is completely down to them how much margin they wanna make. Add to the fact that Apple‚Äôs stuff is way overpriced (surely you guys know about things being overpriced). So on fair value basis, their revenue would be more like 50 to 60bn. The reason they make 89bn is because they are greedy as hell and they have the right to sell it whatever price they want because ppl buy it for the  brand name. 

So if we consider all that together, it isn‚Äôt really that incredible. What is incredible is that it is actually happening whether I like it or not but if you really apply your logic of fair value, it isn‚Äôt.

Apple is a good business but perhaps at its apex. The last two years as you mentioned were phenomenal but one has to wonder how much the stimulus played a part.

    Apple hasn't had much user growth if any at all over the last 2-4 years.Their profits are from charging higher prices to  a saturating consumer base. While this applies specifically to the iphone, its still their biggest money maker and its fair to assume no other product will have the iphone's user base. Apple is too reliant on Foxconn, TSMC, and Samsung to manufacture their products and AWS to host their services. This is not a business that is in the top echelons of tech.

Analysts are quite pessimistic about Apple growth (2.55% in 2022), (3.69% in 2023) and (3.69% in 2024) and if you project 10% until 2027 then you get 7.45% growth, at 15PE a negative growth (-4% to a stock price at $129 in 2027. Of course at the current P/E of 30 you get a better result with a return of 8%.

1) new regulations (especially given the shifting sentiment across the world on antitrust regulation) prohibit such preload payments; or 
2) if Alphabet realizes that there is no need for making such a payment as Google search app is likely to be downloaded by the end user.

But with Apple almost all programs had a cost, so while the computer itself was nice, it was almost useless even for basic activities, because I had to have a separate budget for software I needed to buy. And  of the software bought, Apple of course takes its own commission fee. So Apple makes money off their devices in two ways, both selling them and from their usage.",2

In your video in September, there is 413 dollars for 10 % return. Quite a difference, is not it? Since it is only about 5 months ago, it makes me wonder what changed. Does really one miss in quarter earnings have such a huge influence on the overall return, when it is fast growing company with almost no debt? Everybody is so used to that Meta had no or little competition that everybody is very shocked that Meta has to compete with anybody, what a suprise. Is not exactly the stance of value investor to remove the Wall Street noise and know that when a well established company misses one quarter earnings, with 37 % growth of revenue in comparison to 2020, with 36 % growth in EPS in comparison to 2020, there is not a reason to decrease your expected valuation 50 %? At least this is what I learned from your videos and it made me wonder how much is your stance now different from Wall Street analysts and short-term focused investors (speculators). The valuation of 205 dollars price per a common stock for 10 % return seems a rather very very conservative and strange in comparison to 413 dollars published 5 months ago.

The only problem with a model that assumes a fixed growth rate for 10 years is that. Maybe a better way to read it is: Apple needs to achieve a x% growth rate for the next 10 years to justify its current price. The big question is if you have faith in the leadership to find new areas that innovation can occur and keep the growth going, in the face of competition. As warren Buffet put it: investors invest to make money. Not many people invest just for the prestige.

Seems kind of small to me but maybe he's afraid of losing the person if everyone knows how fantastic a move he made- hard ot know. That person certainly deserves the credit. If it was Ted W., I'm glad you're giving him more of a spotlight. At least Buffet admitted that it was either him or the other staff member. That narrows it down to 2 anyway. :)",0

bft24X7auA8,@Bosshog-WealthHealthBetterment,2022-07-09T20:39:47Z,"Let's be honest, Holmes got a softer sentence because she's female. The sentencing disparity between men and women runs at > 3x the difference between black and white, yet the former is ignored and the latter is held up as a sign of systemic racism. Both the UK and US publish numbers of the subject and see similar ratios. 

In summary, women are seen as being less capable of being devious so when a men is involved they are seen as followers (this was a key argument from Holmes' defence) and they are also more likely to have mitigating circumstances because they look after the elderly and kids at a higher proportion. Not saying either of those reasons are ""fair"" on women, but we shouldn't ignore what is a clear difference in sentencing purely based on gender. 

Arguably, the most important area of all where equality matters is before the law, and I don't see that at all. Whether you're a Classical Liberal (so right leaning) caring about equality of opportunity, of or a Progressive Liberal (so left leaning) caring about equality of outcome, the whole situation should leave a very poor taste in the mouth. 

Holmes should absolutely have been found similarly guilty. That would be equality worth fighting for.",1

bft24X7auA8,@Allen-L-Canada,2022-07-09T04:40:00Z,"Joseph, another insightful show!  I really like the point you make about quantitative and qualitative analysis.  We shouldn't so rigidly focus on the valuation, in some cases such as Buffett's Apple decision, and your CP decision, qualitative aspects such as duration moats will weigh more in decision making.  As Buffett said: it's better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price, than a fair business at a wonderful price.  A practical way to approach this point is this: given two businesses with similar valuations,  we accept a smaller margin of safety (in %) for the business with a more durable moat and vice versa.",1

bft24X7auA8,@zshn,2022-07-08T19:37:13Z,You need to stop comparing stocks with another stock and instead compare it the index/SPY to see if it will outperform or not (growth + dividends included). If your outlook / financial calculation of future earnings and as a consequence future stock price does not outperform the avg. return of SPY; it is not a good investment. You'd rather just buy more SCHD or SPY.,7

If you are not using dividends right now for everyday expenses and are also reinvesting them in same companies wouldn‚Äôt you be better off if the company does stock buybacks instead as it saves you the tax liability? In such a case where you reinvent in same company it‚Äôs the same as buybacks, but buybacks are better as you don‚Äôt pay tax and also in future number of shares reduces so your share of profits increases.",4
