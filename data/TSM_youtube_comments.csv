2kJDTzFtUr4,@NathanYount,2024-09-08T15:08:18Z,"Intel for many years instead of innovating over the years spent large sums of money manipulating the market and corrupting benchmark software.  Look it up follow the finances where these payoffs, for comparison reasons some of these manipulative payoffs account for well over 50% of some of these other companies bottom line for staying silent.  This made it so other companies had to make better processors to compete since the software throttled down the performance while they had less budget and better innovation that often times was ahead of intel that intel had to catch up on, but to be clear Intel from time to time did lead the cutting edge.  I am mainly addressing the mafia like actions in business that made it so their focus wasn't innovation, but espionage, delaying competition, politics, and many other unfocused not exactly moral focal points.  I am a slouch compared to many highly technical people and I was able to prove years ago Intel was doing this bad stuff and if I can prove it then many others could prove it too but were silenced.  If they spent the massive amount of money that paid people off and robbed the public of wealth they could have invested and even bought ASML from Phillips when it was worthless or even at the beginning of its raise documents show it was for sell.  Good thing they didn't since it would have slowed down the world's tech progress and it would be even more expensive than it is now.  As a stock holder of Intel for many years in stock and mutual like funds, I aspect more of intel and they need to keep cleaning house of their cancers some of the internal politics is the similarly but different thing  that is eating Google and a trend towards more amoral tendencies.  The proof is in the timeline of all the delays and why they are still on the old nanometer sizes while the competitors are on 3nm. All this info you can look up especially if you are willing to not get lost in the weeds. ¬†

Disclaimer Intel does own 15% of ASML, TSMC is about 95% owned by public companies and individual investors of which VisEra (combo of OmniVision and TSMC Spinoff as a Sensor Foundry) is the largest co-holder (since they own each other at one point like 67% in TSMC and 87% in VisEra).  For comparison reasons you can view Intel as Inbred producing genetical damaged offspring where TSMC reached out to the world to consolidate and make chips for everyone and use group resources to do so making the cutting edge technology cheaper.  I am personally a fan of this business model, businesses that are deathly afraid of getting there ideas stolen like Intel since that is how they were founded is embedded in their work model and culture.",0,FALSE

2kJDTzFtUr4,@MASMIWA,2023-12-14T00:12:27Z,"Interesting with an American bias clearly showing.  The big American semiconductor companies like AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Apple have their semiconductors made in either TSMC or Samsung.  Rising to compete against these giants are the Chinese, with SMIC the biggest of the bunch in fab.  Huawei's HiSilicon is a leading design company. SMEE is leading China's efforts to develop lithography to compete with ASML.  2024 will see China's rise beyond silicon as SMIC looks to produce 5nm and maybe 3nm chips.  Photonics, graphene, and quantum chips will rise and could possibly replace silicon and achieve functional performance beyond silicon's attempt at 1nm.

Intel achieved 7nm two years ago and SMIC just did. Huawei now has two fabs, one focused on photonics and the other on silicon. China has 44 fabs in production and 12 under construction.  China is replacing the US in mature node semiconductors above 7nm and nibbling away above 7nm. There are media reports that Huawei is organizing the complete semiconductor supply chain so domestic production can be completely Chinese.  China's MIC 2025 appears to be doable in the semiconductor sector as China no longer needs US technology.  In fact, China is number one in international patents for the last 3 years, outpacing the US.

You see the fear in the US government as it attempts to suppress China's semiconductor rise. Literally hundreds of Chinese semiconductor companies have US sanctions placed on them with Huawei taking the crown with the most. The last desperate gasp by the US is to nullify Chinese patents in the US so US companies will not have to pay Chinese patent fees.  It matters not because the Chinese will now become more secretive and we won't know until after the fact what China has achieved.

The TSMC fab in Arizona is halted, it was delayed to 2024 opening and now to 2025.  With China rising in the high end chip sector, there is a good chance it may never open.  Even Intel's super fab in Ohio is questionable.  It has ceased construction and if China can produce 5nm and 3nm chips, it may never see the light of day.  China will compete on price and that drives the economy of semiconductors, everything else being equal.

One thing for sure, the US government is destroying the US semiconductor sector with its sanctions and restrictions. and it is about to destroy the EV sector with its restrictions on subsidies for cars with any link to Chinese battery components. Key to EV batteries is graphite, and the highly refined graphite used in these batteries comes form China. More than 90% of refined graphite comes from China so Biden's attempt to stop Chinese batteries into the US are still born before the word go.

Like the US sanctions on Russia, the harm to Russia is minimal and the victim is the EU.  The US will follow as we enter 2024 as the US economy has the potential for a severe recession. There will be no soft landing.

See this article

China‚Äôs Semiconductor Breakthrough

China plans to build 31 chip factories by 2024 and by 2025 plans to be 67-70% self-sufficient.

According to some Chinese experts, they expect that China maybe, maybe, will be able to be 100% self-sufficient by 2035. But that is not the point. Even with China at 70% self-sufficient it will hurt a lot of chip companies. We have to understand that China at one time was only 3% self-sufficient and was spending around 300-400 billion dollars a year on chips from foreign chip companies-this number has since shrunk to like about 200 billion and getting smaller by the day.

RIP TSMC (Taiwain)
RIP Intel, Micron,Qualcomm, others (USA)
RIP Japan
RIP Samsung (South Korea)
RIP ASML (Ntherlands) -China will be making their own machines as well

I suggest these companies venture into other businesses becuase China also plans to make 75% of all chips when ready. Therefore, non-Chinese companies will have to settle and fight for the 25% leftover in the near future.",1,FALSE

In 2020, the top exporters of Semiconductor Devices were China ($35.8B), Japan ($9.57B), Malaysia ($8.67B). In 2020, the top importers of Semiconductor Devices were Hong Kong ($16.5B), United States ($12.5B), China ($10.8B).

üôè‚ù§  What is the CHIPS and Science Act?

The CHIPS and Science Act aims to reduce the country‚Äôs reliance on overseas supply chains. It provides USD 52.7 billion for manufacturing, research, and communications technology security subsidies.

In 1990, the United States manufactured nearly 40% of the world‚Äôs supply of semiconductors. Today, that share is down to 12%. 

U.S. tech giants Nvidia, Google, and Apple rely on Taiwanese foundries for 90% of their chip production.

‚ÄúSo if some force were to disrupt our ability to buy these chips from Taiwan, it would really be an absolute crisis in our ability to protect ourselves,‚Äù Secretary Raimondo shared with Marketplace.

üôè‚ù§  The construction of a semiconductor foundry requires 6,000 construction workers, costs USD 10 to 20 billion and can take anywhere from three to five years to build.

The CHIPS and Science Act is only the start of a long journey. ‚ÄúThe future is going to be made in America.‚Äù

2kJDTzFtUr4,@johndoh5182,2022-11-18T04:13:36Z,"Intel is not stuck on 10nm.  They were stuck at 14nm.  Intel rebranded their process nodes to be in line with TSMC's transistor density which is what matters the most.  So these numbers, 10nm 5nm, etc..... don't mean anything.  They are advertising terms.

So, Intel right now is on the equiv. to TSMC 7nm, actually the name is N7.  So TSMC has a ONE node advantage over Intel, not two.  Intel is supposed to be on their ""Intel 4"" process node in 2023.  When this happens this puts them much closer to TSMC who will be getting close to being in risk production on their 3nm node, or N3.

There are multiple mistakes in the video.  One is suggesting that Intel has processors made using TSMC.  Actually Intel has contracts from other companies to make chips, and part of the time Intel doesn't have the capacity to so they outsource to TSMC for this, but Intel processors are made on Intel wafers.

Intel IS using TSMC to made their graphics chips for their new line of graphics cards that go into a PC.  This is a new line of products for Intel.",1,FALSE

my face off for self-governance because I'm self-governance for the solver and you asking me to come officially to decide that I do not want to come to because of some mutations you trying to regulate me and I said no that's not right because I have rights people people out here just don't fail to realize that it's like I'm having the problems in this city and I'm constantly keep having them you have too much corruption that goes on for no reason when a person has been given and making sure that the people don't have to go through that with the corruption of fighting to try to get a dime and a penny in a dollar when the person has made sure that the system has picked up to give the money more but they fail to realize that that's where they're feeling yet they think that they're wise they think that their knowledgeable they think that they're very smart but I see the opposite in their actions they're going to say that who am I to judge who am I to say but I've been sitting back for too long watching when my DNA is higher than everybody on this planet so I have every right to say what I have to say when I'm telling the truth that is freedom of speech and freedom of speech is when you were telling the truth if it's lies that's not a freedom there's no freedom in lieing I'm trying to get them to understand that when we're almost in 2023 and we're still behind as a people they're laughing they're being hypocrites they've been blasphemy they're being out of control they've been disrespectful but they fell in the realize their failing people going to get an attitude their failing they're being sore losers they're being losers and it looks like like my sister said like s*** and it doesn't make sense the force the discrepancies of our ancestors too many of the ancestors has paid blood sweat tears emotions their life the bloodline for us to pick up and they fill the realize that what was the point of your of their ancestors giving up their life people always have some smart to say watch this you're going to have idiots say something smart you're going to idiot be stupid and do some dumb but they're feeling to realize what look at it look how they look look what goes on every day look how we aren't investing and I think we're advancing we're 20 almost 23 years behind they have headphones since the 90s and the phones in the 90s were 20034,000 dollars and they said that we have advance to me it seems like it's not far fetched off from what it was then just a little bit more it was deal with the the dod it set which is a little bit more do you say what are you talking about well this is more programming that's how I feel about the technology the electronical components which deals with electronical technology or electronical technicians I went to a school and got certified for et at Randolph here in Detroit that was the main reason why they wanted me to stay because time would be correct right now if I would have stayed there and done what I need to do every action has a reaction it has and has a cause and has an effect for me not staying and not doing doing it there and only just testing out there were a cause and effect and the cause and effect is is that we're behind when somebody stays on these people they have a problem and issue with people staying on them because they're being failures and see that the people have no reason to be that way and it doesn't make any sense for them to be behind like that when they all hear stealing killing and robbing people they could be sitting down walking digging up dirt getting the material and helping to provide to to push the the basement further that's what I mean by people out here doing stupid stuff people mad because the phones are garbage that they give it people are mad because technology is behind people talk mess about video games but the video games is the only thing that is up to date you have d o d and armed forces computers that were pre-made for trial and error that they took down and said they're obsolete because they're too far behind to get those computers to run properly they're very slow you can't even use 50 GB before the computer start having crash problems before you can't even have problems with the cracking in before you start having problems with the computer running slow activity is very down people don't know there's two different types of memory in every device that they had you have local and you have hard drive the local memory sucks cuz brain computing power sucks the CPU on the computer sucks they say oh that phone has 512 members processing per and then they say well it's a 60 GB phone or 32 GB phone well then brain power computer sucks it's a lot of stuff is wrong and behind a phone who cares is they're behind on phones they're behind on the tablets they're behind on the laptops they're behind on the watches and they're definitely behind on the glasses because all that money for all that stuff and it's all behind it's all outdated stuff that's why I haven't been buying it if they feel to realize if they watch the consumption of what I bought I'm not buy anything that's outdated if it's outdated I'm not buying it because it means that I can't use it and some of the stuff I have right now I'm mad because it is outdated and that's no lie that's the reason why they haven't seen me use some of the stuff because it's outdated my computing and my programming takes a lot of program and it takes a lot of cold my brain computing power it's beyond fast of a human when I do something I do it Way beyond a human capacity even when they look at it sometimes they're going to say this is beyond they're going to say no no human has created this this looks like alien technology because the computing of program when I made tomorrow alliance I made it and they still don't even know how I made that when it says I they don't even know they can't even compute how I even made that cuz my brain power is Way beyond theirs of course we have liars of course we have thieves just like watch dogs that's the reason why I watch dogs don't work for none of them that's the reason why I Grand theft Auto doesn't work for any of them they all keep saying the game but it's not a game a little Linux Bass programming is not a game. They're feeling to realize if I ever get my hands all these type of machines to help me do cutting and making parts 3D printers or duv systems or euv systems anything and everything that deals with making glasses watches phones tablets computers any type of computer chips to run any type of anything it all will change I don't know what they're on but wasting products to make old stuff is crazy anyone that does that doesn't have a mind to understand where I'm coming from when you already have shortage problem we're getting what More produce when they're depleting the orange Earth from his resources so that would have common sense to not even what once your products unless the stuff we already been through the lesser stuff 5G was supposed to be a 2005 when they ask me and said down to Georgia that they want to do 10g I said what I don't do no 10 g so we supposed to be further than that crazy I told him all today face down there in Georgia that's a man we'll be way behind and that was 2014 14 15 16 and almost 17 when I told him that we're behind like that we've already supposed to have been on the 14 g15 g16g and 17g according to this new timeline they think that I'm being mean but I'm telling them the things are outdated the Motorola phone is out there but updated because the computer the chips has to be updated you have phones that don't even have projectors you have a few phones that have projector screens for attachments or no attachments and is automatically attached like the Samsung beam it's automatically attached the Apple phones get pre-attachments the Motorola play with z with the mods attachments. So when they're picking and starting mess about something that doesn't matter petty stuff they should worry about the more important stuff like this stuff that I'm complaining about the stuff that they fail to do and pick up on they have no time to be out here picking and starting mess with people but to get up and get that stuff done and to get it up to date and to part the time until our timeline they spend their time too much into the wrong instead of advancement like I was saying about the the bomb dropping the missile shooting the gunpowder and bullets and all this stuff they're using but we're they're failing because they're missing yeah those use computerships don't they so we will common Sense does that make wasting what doesn't make sense all that stuff there with the computer chips and and all that technology that they're wasting on could have been put into making into getting more why are they dropping bombs those bombs could have been lifting lifting aircrafts in there while they was dropping those bombs Japan just filled on a missile launch why they dropping bombs Japan did another rocket launch to go to space again and they fail what what eight satellites in it with with Russia shooting all those bombs and all those missiles and all that gunpowder and all that gas and all that that power to get to another planet to grab them material and come back with all that with all that stuff that they're wasting no accomplishment failures fill in the objectives and goals that we are set here on this Earth to do they're trying to figure out what if I objective whatever our goals why are we here living while we breathing while we here on this Earth that's the main reason why Elon musk lost",0,FALSE

You are misunderstanding how stocks work. Stocks typically are a long term investment. And for the long term it is not clear what their position will be in chip making.
Silicon is nearing end of life, cannot improve further as you reach the atom ( atom is 0.2 nm big). Only by switching materials you can improve, and what is the position of ASML going to be for that? Unsure. So investing in ASML is a bit risky.
Just because you are dominating the industry now does not mean your company is highly profitable either.

2kJDTzFtUr4,@timhaley3459,2022-09-07T19:27:58Z,"The making of ""chips"" (and not the ones bought at a local grocery store, though Lays Potato chips are tasty with hamburgers), as with both DUV (Deep Ultraviolet Lithography) and EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography) should convince reasonable people, some ""doubters"" or even some atheists, that the universe with its material life on the earth, that is of such complexity as to be incomprehensible, is not some sort of ""accident"", but required ""someone"" with power and capabilities beyond human intellectual ability.


The universe is of such gargantuan proportions that it is impossible to comprehend its size, much less its precise laws and statues that must be perfectly harmonious in order for it to function. Harry Cliff, a particle physicist at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva, Switzerland, said in 2016, that there are ' two dangerous numbers in the universe that are responsible for all the matter, structure, and life that we witness across the cosmos'. He further said that "" if these two numbers (strength of the Higgs field and of dark energy) were even slightly different, the universe would be an empty, lifeless place"". 


And he even went further in how critical, how precise the forces involved are, stating concerning the strength of the Higgs field (said to be caused by the Higgs boson), an invisible energy field not unlike other magnetic fields that permeates the universe, that ""either it should be turned off, meaning it would have a strength value of zero and wouldn't be working to give particles mass, or it should be turned on"", and that this ""on value"" is ""absolutely enormous"". But neither of those two scenarios are what physicists observed.


He says that in reality, ""the Higgs field is just slightly on........It's not zero, but it's ten-thousand-trillion times weaker than it's fully on value ‚Äî a bit like a light switch that got stuck just before the 'off ' position. And this value is crucial. If it were a tiny bit different, then there would be NO physical structure in the universe."" 


Even a simple toothpick requires a maker (using complex machinery to do just this), so that the universe with its life demands that a Creator of such capability with unimaginable power and wisdom be ""the source of life"" as the Bible points out at Psalms 36:9. Nothing we use came about without a mind, every tool, pen, spoon, fork, laptop, mobile phone, car, the Space Station, Hubble Space telescope, etc.


If, say a auto technician, were to change the precise measurements in the engine of a car, what would happen ? Changing the internal measurements within the engine by just a couple of thousandth of an inch of clearance, say between the rod bearings and the crankshaft, and it will seize up if too close, or lose oil pressure and eventually lock up if you go the other way by just a small increment.


But life is of such preciseness that it cannot be fathomed. This obliges that a Supreme Designer be the ""cause"" of the universe, who created the atom of such smallness (and changeability, kind of like a Lego set) as to be unable to be see its ""particles"" that makes it up, even with an electron or atomic microscope, with its myriads of particles flying around its nucleus, constantly changing, losing or gaining particles that changes its ""composition"" and polarity, that allows for the universe with its life on the earth to not just exist, but flourish.

But who really wants to search for the Supreme Designer and understand his purpose, say for the earth ?",0,FALSE

NASA rovers do not use ""5 nm"" chips. Space is very heritage focused and thus most ICs that fly in space are at least 20 nm parts, most are 250 nm or more. Processing power for space tends to lag about a decade behind commercial.

There are no ""5"" or ""3"" or ""7"" nm features on these chips. The Intel naming scheme is more honest. These ""nodes"" are really about logic density increases. One ""7 nm"" part isn't the same as the others. Intel ""10 nm"" is closer first generation 7 nm TSMC/Samsung processes in terms of actual density. 

The ""chip shortage"" during the pandemic was across many sectors. Consumer products like XBOXes and GPUs for bitcoin mining used the more advanced nodes from TSMC. However automotive chip for things other than infotainment, and vision systems are generally 65 nm+ (when these nm number were actual gate lengths). With Micron's target reduction in memory the cyclical nature of the DRAM/FLASH business is showing the consumer market is no longer supply constrained. That actually means leading edge capacity is available. What is not available are things like digital isolators produced by companies like Texas Instruments, Analog Devices/Maxium. 

What is funny about the obsession of the financial reporting about chips is the crazy monolithic focus on digital processing. You need to build a radio for a phone. You need sensors, microphones, cameras. Without the interaction surface to the world which is analog you can do nothing interesting. That interface can be a keyboard or it can be a camera, but it is still not a ""leading edge"" chip. 

Don't have a leading edge CPU or GPU, your application runs a bit slower. Don't have a digital isolator you cannot make a car at all or a medical device. These things are the chip shortage that matters and the companies are over ordering having moved from just in time supply chains to inventory ones. 

Shortages for things like Neon from the war in Ukraine are important too. ASML didn't needed advanced chips to make their lithography tool they needed microcontroller and 20 nm FPGAs. 

Can Intel catch up in manufacturing? Yes. With the right people hired this can be done. The bigger problem for Intel is actually one of strategy they have really done poorly making choices of what to do outside of computer processors. With lots of half hearted efforts that are folded up and tossed. A pivot to primarily being a foundry that happens to have a successful processor business solves them needing to figure out the consumer and just needs to figure out physical science. They are actually good at that historically so they can get there. In the end the nodes are slowing and will stall out soon enough. Global Foundries didn't quit for no reason. What Intel is trying to do is get scale enough to complete with TSMC in volume. They are also trying to be more than a digital company by buying Tower I think...",145,FALSE

To make these chips we need to create transistors on it. We do this by mixing some material to one region and another material to another region. To do that we coat the silicon disk (waffer) with a plastic that get brittle when light hits it. We then wash the waffer and add the material we want. We repeat the process for how many different regions we need.

The machine used is like a reverse video projector (or, if you're older, a reverse slide projector): it gets a huge image source and projects it on a tine square on the surface of the waffer. To do that we need some special lenses and projectors. There's another problem: we want to get more transistors on the same small square because that saves us waffers and also allows for chips that consume less electricity. The smallest line (thinnest) used started to get so thin it got smaller than the wavelength of visible light - and that means we can't do it with visible light. People started using ultra-violet and x-ray to do that but that is not so easy!

You know how 5GHz wifi doesn't go as far as 2.4GHz? 5GHz has smaller wavelength than 2.4GHz and that causes 5GHz radio signals from wifi to interact more with walls and doors. The kinds of frequency needed to make a 7nm chip are so high the light interacts even with the glass used to make the mirrors! These machines, for those reasons, are so complicated people don't even want to try and develop their own. Even Japan's governement gave up on their attempt. Japan ruled this market in the past, btw - so they were not starting from zero.

In reality, chip manufacturing demands MORE R&D than designing a chip! A chip designer does NOT get involved in how to build a transistor as small as 2nm (start of the art as of 2024). He leaves it to the black magic at the chip manufacturer. This is where TSMC comes in. A virus is 100 nm. 2nm is 50x smaller than a virus! Though the equipment to manufacture is made in the U.S. and the Netherlands, how to use this equipment is totally up to the chip manufacturers like TSMC. This is like I can buy the same oven that is also used by a world-class chef, but I can't bake award-winning cookies. That chef has his secret recipes, but I follow a standard cookbook. TSMC and its competitors develop these secret recipes, which cost billions of R&D dollars annually. As long as TSMC is the largest manufacturer in the world, it can naturally afford the biggest R&D budget that its competitors can only dream of. As a result, big customers like Apple or Nvidia naturally line up behind TSMC because they want to have the smallest transistors so that they can pack more of them into the same real estate. This monopolistic following ensures TSMC remains the largest, and thus the biggest R&D budget. It's a POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP that makes Intel or Samsung can't even come close. Intel and Samsung also have a handicap that TSMC doesn't. These 2 design chips too. In other words, they compete with their own customers! If Intel can produce chips for Apple, it can steal Apple's IP. TSMC only focuses on how to make a transistor as small as possible and thus alleviate the IP theft concern for its customers.",0,FALSE

Additionally, it has benefited from institutional advantages such as low-cost universal education. Seizing the opportunity presented by the semiconductor industry's shift after the US-Japan semiconductor war in the 1980s, Taiwan has vigorously developed the semiconductor manufacturing and chip design industries. Currently, due to the advantages of unfair policies, many semiconductor companies in Taiwan have grown to the extent that they can compete with leading US companies. For example, MediaTek surpassed Qualcomm to become the world's top mobile chip processor company. This success is not solely attributed to MediaTek's capabilities but stems from the unfair competitive advantage.
Given this situation, the United States cannot tolerate the continuation of such circumstances. It is time to counteract and dismantle Taiwan's semiconductor industry, including companies like TSMC and MediaTek.",0,FALSE

in the mean time car makers could go back to carburating cars temporarily until the chips can get stocked up.

one way to help encourage fabs to move to the united states is to blindly trust them and drop the licensing requirement for obtaining the exotic chemicals that may be included as drug pre cursors such as methylamine so if the fab does not have to obtain a license then they can get in the united states.

could the fabs install massive refrigeration units to collect water from the air and supply their needs or power their entire plant from hydrogen fuel cells witch creates water as a by product?

they could cut analog all together and go digital.

GU87SH5e0eI,@SeeMoreLevingthon,2022-06-26T06:10:33Z,"You keep making the mistake that a bigger nanometer-number automatically means bigger chips and that's not true. It can be, but it's not a causal relationship. The coffeemaker chips you mentioned are usually ARM-based or other RISC architecture, aiming at providing the most specialized logic. Specializing it also means cutting out unnecessary logic, so you end up with a smaller die, which lowers cost per chip as you get more chips per wafer AND you get a better yield, as smaller chips are less likely to contain an error that would make them unusable. So, a 14-nanometer specialized CPU might be much smaller than a general compute 7-nanometer consumer CPU, for example. 
This is why it's not correct to say ""bigger chips"" for chips that have been manufactured on older nodes. Yes, smaller nodes mean smaller transistors OR smaller transistor elements OR less unlogic space OR something related (it's not standardized what it means, by the way) BUT that also means that designers can now keep the chip's size the same while cramming more logic per area unit. So, chips might be getting smaller while keeping the same functionality as before OR they might be keeping their size but add functionality. Heck, they might even get bigger, like Cerebra's WSE. ALSO, if you're talking about chips, you should be able to make the distinction between CPUs and SoCs, for example, and types of chips and packaging.",0,FALSE

We also got an unprecedented explosion in demand due to the global lockdown so any would-be surplus silicon is immediately picked up. The fabs aren't magically gonna have your wafers for you just because you misjudged the demand on your product end (which is what the bean counters at the car manufacturers did).

We were also sure it will reduce climate disasters due to the reduction of carbon dioxide exhausts thinking that Coronavirus shall solve a problem which the Paris climate agreement could not ,while it (the agreement) used to call for reducing 50% of these exhausts; however, it was not applied because countries were afraid on their economy to be hit hard but corona came and stopped the carbonic emissions by 100% for many months, and we thought that climate disasters shall be reduced. But we were shocked as the complete opposite happened! Instead of reducing the climate disasters the intensity of the climatic war causing floods and hurricanes has increased all around the world like never before so Coronavirus has destroyed the global warming theory since the Paris climate agreement was not applied ;given that they have agreed upon reducing 50% of factories exhausts, but Coronavirus has reduced them by 100% for many months due to the quarantine and mass lockdown; on the other hand, the intensity of climatic disasters unprecedentedly increased since 2020 till now; hence the global warming theory has failed
O Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, your statements about different matters are verified on actual reality, and those who follow them know this as you have been denying and disbelieving in the global warming theory for more than 16 years, and said that the planet of fire, Saqar, is approaching the Earth and affecting it from a distant place and you have written many statements concerning this matter but we still have not believed you and we believed the global warming theory that then has failed! So could you extract from the Great Quran what proofs that virus corona was sent by Allah to verify your fatwa to demolish the global warming theory as it will force us to stop our factories and wheel of carbonic life for many months, then, it raises the intensity of the unprecedented climate war to destroy the global warming theory?"" Then, I reply to the questioners and say: you shall find the news in the word of Allah the Exalted: {But those who deny Our signs - We will progressively lead them [to destruction] from where they do not know. (182) And I will give them time. Indeed, my plan is firm. (183) Then do they not give thought? There is in their companion no madness. He is not but a clear warner. (184) Do they not look into the realm of the heavens and the earth and everything that Allah has created and [think] that perhaps their appointed time has come near? So in what statement hereafter will they believe? (185) Whomsoever Allah sends astray, none can guide him; and He lets them wander blindly in their transgressions. (186)

Then, you look at the solar system where you will find them abnormal including the sun because it has been confused with the coming of something invisible which is going to affect everything Created by Allah in the solar system ,and the solar system is incapable of resisting the Planet of the greatest catastrophe; that is Planet Saqar, the so-called Nibiru. And the time of your evil doom will approach, the night when the planet passes on the sky of the Earth. So is there anyone who will be mindful and reflect upon the news in the Book of Allah the Great Quran? in line with the Word of Allah the Exalted:

This a conclusive evidence that Planet Saqar, the so-called Nibiru, is truly approaching, and due to its approach your appointed time will be on the day when it passes on your sky. And the evidence on its approaching is when you find it affecting all the planets, moons, meteors, axis and movements of the solar system and its celestial angels, as its effect in the news of the inclusive Reminder (Quran) shall reach all of Allah's creation in the solar system, in line with the Word of Allah the Exalted: {Do they not look into the realm of the heavens and the earth and everything that Allah has created and [think] that perhaps their appointed time has come near?

GU87SH5e0eI,@naderghannam4807,2021-10-18T18:44:54Z,"""Furthermore, the mass lockout in the world due to Corona has made the major countries know that the global warming did not happen because of factories but because of another reason which they hide from the world, and I know that they are guessing blindly that there is a planet approaching the Earth even though they have not seen it directly due to its different colours; to illustrate, white like the sun, red, and black so how are they going to see a planet that is covered with fire that is darker than a new moon, can you see a new moon despite its closeness to the Earth? It is the same case for planet Saqar when it is covered with intense black fire. But they will know about its coming from scientific theories through its effect on all the planets of the solar system, the sun, and the moon. And the sun has caught up with the moon due to the approach of Planet Saqar, so the full moon occurs ahead of its time before the night of the middle of the lunar month as a repetitive warning in the sky of humans but did not cause them any remembrance
Moreover, consecutive climatic disasters are going to befall you and I do not think that it will cause you any remembrance as those fools who do not reason, think, nor believe but what NASA announced, ignoring what Allah's caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani has stated of news that are the truest Words of Allah Lord of the worlds, but NASA and others hide this truth from the worlds and NASA the so-called protector of planet Earth from the dangers of the meteors of planetoids will not benefit you, and I swear by Allah they could not protect themselves from the Planetoid of the first Rajefah (quake). Indeed, Allah will target with the Planetoid of torment the United States of America and they would not be able to protect themselves and it will strike in the speed of light in the land behind the Atlantic Ocean in the USA, in line with the Word of Allah the Exalted: {And Our command is but one, like a glance of the eye.

The two new plants Intel are building in AZ are both 2nm plants.  For Intel, the names of those nodes are Intel 3, and then Intel 20A.  Intel is behind right now by one node size, in actual transistor density.  But, they've had an issue with power efficiency with their current latest node, which used to be called a 10nm node.  They've renamed the node Intel 7 since transistor density is on par with TSMC 7nm which is what a lot of the world is using right now as a leading edge node.  Only a couple companies are on TSMC 5nm since it's still in its first year run.  One is Apple.  Apple is a risk partner by making a contract with TSMC when these new nodes are ready.

Intel's fabrication problem has also caused them to lose business to other fabless companies, like AMD.  To counter this, Intel joined Apple in becoming a risk partner for TSMC 3nm which is supposed to start production in 2022.  So, Apple and Intel have the first run of TSMC 3nm.  Intel doesn't have a 5nm node, it has a 4nm node, called Intel 4.  So really by the time 2025 rolls around the world of fabrication is going to be interesting.  I'm pretty sure though most older companies that haven't adopted the latest EUV technology are going to be hard pressed to find customers.  What will happen is the price will drop on nodes as small as 7nm, as 5nm, 3nm and 2nm will be very common by then.  Maybe not 2nm, but certainly 3nm.

Also, Samsung is expanding their capacity in Austin for 5nm fabrication.  So, in about 3 years there should be an abundance of higher quality ICs, and the world is going to need it.  ICs made on 5nm, 3nm and 2nm are going to be much more power efficient.",4,FALSE

In 250 years of existence as a nation, the US has fought against 29 sovereign countries. (In Fact, since 1785, US have been involved, for 219 years, in some kind of war. And this wars, against all varieties of sovereign nations. From going against the Sultan of Morocco, to invading the tiny island of Grenada. Well, this means that in its entire history, it has only had 17 years of peace, and even fewer, cuz here the almost 5 years (1861-1865), of its Civil War of Secession are not counted (Union/Confederates), since this war was not with another country, but against US. And the wars against the Native Nations of America are not counted too, for the same reason). Anyway: US fought against 29 countries. It has ""Grown"" 711 times the size of its territory from the original 13 colonies. It has provoked with total impunity, Genocides, inside and outside its own borders, and assassinations of Gov‚Äôt. Leaders, Coups d'√âtat and Economic Blockades in 6 UN member nations. (Between 1947 and 1989, the US tried to change other nations gov‚Äôts. 73 times. It includes 66 covert Ops. And 7 overt ones. In Civil Wars: The US has taken advantage of and intervened without justification in the following Civil Wars: In Cuba (1898 and 1960). In Haiti (1813 and then 1915-1934). In Colombia (1899-1902 and 1948). In Mexico (1847 and 1914 and again in 1916). In Russia (1918). In the ""Republic Banana Wars"" of Central America (1912-1934). In Venezuela (1945 and again in 1948). In China (1857, and 1900, and again in 1945-1946-1949). In Korea (1950-1953). In Viet Nam (1959-1975). In Panama (1964 and again 1989). In Central Africa (1969-1974 and 1982-1988). In Nicaragua (1937 and 1985). In Bosnia (1995). In the Philippines (1898 and 1900)... In Kosovo, Libya, Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Afghanistan, etc.). And more: US has almost 800 Military Bases scattered around the world; 93 of which are against China. On the other hand, China and N. Korea (The ""Axis of Evil""), in 1,000 years of history have NEVER invaded anyone. These nations have fought their Civil Wars, defended themselves against foreign invasions, and secured their immediate borders, but they have never been meddling or aggressor countries. Do you know how many Military Bases China or N. Korea have outside their territory? None. Zero. Any. NADA! They do not have a single Base. These are verifiable facts. Neither China nor Korea will invade the world; US does... that's DONE, as US does in the Middle East. Iran also does not have a SINGLE MILITARY BASE outside its national territory, and it is surrounded by 16 US Bases, and it is US who call the Iranians Terrorists. Well, very good. You already know. Now, compare the Greatness of the US with the Greatness of China.

In 250 years of existence as a nation, the US has fought against 29 sovereign countries. (In Fact, since 1785, US have been involved, for 219 years, in some kind of war. And this wars, against all varieties of sovereign nations. From going against the Sultan of Morocco, to invading the tiny island of Grenada. Well, this means that in its entire history, it has only had 17 years of peace, and even fewer, cuz here the almost 5 years (1861-1865), of its Civil War of Secession are not counted (Union/Confederates), since this war was not with another country, but against US. And the wars against the Native Nations of America are not counted too, for the same reason). Anyway: US fought against 29 countries. It has ""Grown"" 711 times the size of its territory from the original 13 colonies. It has provoked with total impunity, Genocides, inside and outside its own borders, and assassinations of Gov‚Äôt. Leaders, Coups d'√âtat and Economic Blockades in 6 UN member nations. (Between 1947 and 1989, the US tried to change other nations gov‚Äôts. 73 times. It includes 66 covert Ops. And 7 overt ones. In Civil Wars: The US has taken advantage of and intervened without justification in the following Civil Wars: In Cuba (1898 and 1960). In Haiti (1813 and then 1915-1934). In Colombia (1899-1902 and 1948). In Mexico (1847 and 1914 and again in 1916). In Russia (1918). In the ""Republic Banana Wars"" of Central America (1912-1934). In Venezuela (1945 and again in 1948). In China (1857, and 1900, and again in 1945-1946-1949). In Korea (1950-1953). In Viet Nam (1959-1975). In Panama (1964 and again 1989). In Central Africa (1969-1974 and 1982-1988). In Nicaragua (1937 and 1985). In Bosnia (1995). In the Philippines (1898 and 1900)... In Kosovo, Libya, Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Afghanistan, etc.). And more: US has almost 800 Military Bases scattered around the world; 93 of which are against China. On the other hand, China and N. Korea (The ""Axis of Evil""), in 1,000 years of history have NEVER invaded anyone. These nations have fought their Civil Wars, defended themselves against foreign invasions, and secured their immediate borders, but they have never been meddling or aggressor countries. Do you know how many Military Bases China or N. Korea have outside their territory? None. Zero. Any. NADA! They do not have a single Base. These are verifiable facts. Neither China nor Korea will invade the world; US does... that's DONE, as US does in the Middle East. Iran also does not have a SINGLE MILITARY BASE outside its national territory, and it is surrounded by 16 US Bases, and it is US who call the Iranians Terrorists. Well, very good. You already know. Now, compare the Greatness of the US with the Greatness of China.

Do you really think a company like Microsoft or Google are not going to be worth considerably more then they are now in 2-5 years time? I believe it's a fallacy to play a value game so strictly.

Paying 30 times earnings for a company with the widest moat I've ever seen in the foundry industry which is essentially impossible for new players to break into is a great deal in my opinion if you just have a little vision about the future.

And to think TSMC is doing this while at the same time spending aggressively to further widen its moat between itself in its competitors.

If the economic war against China is just the US vs China with the rest of the world sitting on the sidelines. US might well lose. So provoking a Chinse invasion of Taiwan sooner than later is what the neocons want and in fact need. China's economy has been growing faster than the US for decades and a year aog was predicted to pass the US in 2028.  Winning an economic war against China gets harder every year.  On the other hand a Chinese blockade of Taiwan would cripple the US economy. That's why the US is investing 50B to attract TSMC, Samsung, Intel to build new fabs. The TSMC 1st fab in Ariz would represent just 10% of TSMC's total production. But with TSMC's 2nd fab plus Intel and Samsung that would be close to 40% of TSMC's total production.   The US could survive a blockade of Taiwan after these 4 fabs are up and running. That would be the 2026 time frame. By that time more US restrictions on Taiwan chip exports to China also means China would not be much affect by a shut down of the chip industry on Taiwan. So for Taiwan that is the most dangerous time a time when a declaration of independence could mean the destruction of its semiconductor industry.

I very much appreciate that you are shedding light on a subject that most people are woefully ignorant about.
From the wording in your title, one would come to conclude that you are the opinion that China invading Taiwan is a foregone conclusion.
Or perhaps it's a clarion call to awaken people to the ""possibility"" of a war and the ramifications.
You mentioned xi jinping's always wanting to ""shoot the messenger "".
A case in point.
Early on, Australia called for an investigation of the origin of the Wuhan covid 19 virus.
In his typical knee-jerk over reaction, xi imposed trade sanctions on coal, iron ore, grains and various other things items.
Once again he shot himself in the foot.
Australia found other markets and China is experiencing power blackouts and food shortages.
A wise man once said:
When you find yourself in a hole, lay down your shovel and stop digging.

I don't see war as an inevitably.
The consequences for China would considerable.
I find it ironic that the covid-19 virus, which originated in Wuhan, may ultimately result in xi jinping's undoing.
As well as that of the thoroughly corrupt ccp.

His ""xero-covid"" policy is an abysmal failure.
Further, not even North Korea wants the Sinovac because of it's extremely poor efficacy rate.
They can't even give it away.

Only when the ccp embraced ""rank capitalism"" did it experience growth and prosperity.
Their version of socialism/Marxism with ""Chinese characteristics"".
Xi's arrogance and belligerence towards it neighbors has resulted in very few friends indeed.
Now he's trying his best to bully and intimidate Taiwan into submission.

The Paper Dragon is ""playing with fire"" and xi may well have to learn it the hard way.

War against the Western Powers would be both untenable and suicide for the Chinese.

Nor do they have the capabilities to wage such a thing.

*the concern is that their troops either seize the microchip factories or destroy them* 

They would have to make a successful beach landing to even attempt this, which is nearly impossible at this time, so this is wishful thinking at best, fantasy at worst.

*making China the only country with those microchips and setting the world back for years*

China does not have the technical knowledge to create high end chips, or they would have done so already.

Taiwan would destroy the fabs long before Chinese troops would ever be able to reach these sites (and that is removing the US and western powers military intervention.) 

This is not even remotely possible.

*Even a slight disruption in microchip production can cause a major shortage for a few years*

The US is already gearing up to increase manufacturing of high end chips, and Taiwan is in the process of reshoring their manufacturing to safer shores.

Taiwan has 1.6 million military personnel at any given time. There's no way China can transport 3 million soldiers across the Taiwan strait. On top of that, all natural born Taiwanese citizens are required to go through military training, so many Taiwanese people can pick up a weapon and defend an invasion. Assume that China sends 200,000 troops across the Taiwan Strait to invade Taiwan, they would require 1000 ships just to transport the troops Taiwan. Taiwan's air force and ground missiles can sink half of those ships before they reach the shores of Taiwan. Let's assume half of those troops do arrive on the shores of Taiwan, they would be decimated by the ground defense in Taiwan as there would be plenty of time for Taiwan to prepare as soon as they detect troop being mobilized from China. If 100,000 Chinese soldiers die on the Taiwan Strait trying to invade Taiwan, imagine the uproar from the Chinese people. That would topple the communist government of China.

Not trying to insult you Alex, but I do think the comparison with what is going on in Russia right now is a logical fallacy that can not be compared to Russia.

There are just so many layers of business of all sizes and industries that China and the U.S have woven together for me to believe this would actually happen. To take such a massive gamble is unlikely. It's always strange to see American media otherize those who are not allies while simultaneously projecting the violent acitons of Western nations onto others as if they were no different from us. Here in the U.S, soy bean and fish farmers alone felt the impact of Trump's trade war. That doesn't even take into consideration of wool farmers in New Zealand who also felt the impact as a result of changed shipping due to the trade war.

Following Japan's surrender at the end of World War II, the Chinese Civil War broke out. The CCP, led by Mao Zedong, triumphed and founded the PRC on October 1, 1949, with Beijing as its capital. In contrast, the defeated ROC government, led by the Kuomintang, retreated to Taiwan on December 7, 1949, along with approximately 2 million troops, officers, civilians, and refugees, fleeing the People‚Äôs Liberation Army. The ROC had intended this move as a temporary measure, hoping to regroup and retake the mainland. However, this never occurred, and Taiwan instead became the center of the ROC's modernization and economic development efforts. China's plan to ""reintegrate"" Taiwan‚Äîa sovereign nation not universally recognized‚Äîaims to influence companies like AMD, Nvidia, and others, including Intel. Despite having their own fabrication plants and production services, these companies rely on TSMC, as does the rest of the semiconductor industry, to operate at scale and meet customer demand.",1,FALSE

It marked the onset of WWII in Asia. Ironically, the war is more widely recognized for its conclusion with the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Following Japan's surrender, all Samurai swords were confiscated. Among these were ancient, invaluable works of art, destroyed and melted down as symbols of surrender and the loss of power. The people who most resisted the CCP, fled to Taiwan and the surrounding islands, which have been inaccessible to China.

TNwnyA_N9ZM,@michaelwang6125,2023-07-27T17:31:47Z,"its kind of difficult which is why its trying to take it by backing pro-China candidates for the presidential election.
Or at least use it as a mean to weaken/divide it from within... much like how America's enemy (you know WHO) has been actively pushing to divide America politically by pushing the political party to ""Far Right -/nationalism Republic"" and ""Far Left -/socialism Democratic"" << this is the view as an outsider where Moscow backs the right and Beijing favors the right as a way to *divide and rule* 
Note: This doesn't mean Beijing or Moscow actually support either of the party but are mainly using it to divide or strike at their current enemy and when that has been achieved...  Beijing will likely get rid of the partner that helped it achieve its goal once they become either politically inconvenient or cease to need to maintain their deal (like what was done to Tibetian who agree to forfeit military control in exchange for religious sovereignty which only lasted for X years when Beijing backtrack it)

Hmm, using historic references and facts: 
USSR-backed Communist party used the farmer-etc to lead the revolution that saw victory by promising equality-etc ... the farmers rebel against the landlord which eventually won but not even 5-10% of them actually benefit from it.  It just shifts from one overlord to another landlord.
Meanwhile; those who either surrendered/helped the rebel (ccp at that time) win the battle over the mainland got their fate by ... going into the Korea & Vietnam war.
To Beijing's political party at that time... those who take up arms to rebel against the past ruler may do the same to them so one of the high-official basically say ""Reducing their number is also in the interest of ...""

vice-versa~ had Ukraine been taken by Moscow within 1-3 weeks; those who stayed will probably get recruited by Moscow to become soldier and fight to liberate Moldova and beyond... kind of revert back to how Stalin used to rule.

~~~Its important to note that Taiwan did have a pro-Beijing president about a decade ago~~~
He also pushes for a non-transparent economic trade deal with Beijing and when i say non-transparent... they basically want it to pass without any discussion, oversight or want it to be postponed for any reason... aka its similar to the age of appeasement where even S.Korea signed an FTA with Beijing around that time.
Fortunately for Formosa-Taiwan; it was blocked by a *sunflower student movement* and participants eventually got their activity (given Taiwan is a democratic nation).  It would have tied Taiwan economically to Beijing and worst will enable Beijing to take over the island by $$$ alone since the deal would enable investor who open business to obtain Taiwanese citizenship and immigrate their family-etc ~ so i.e if the government help fund/subsidies xx billion... it could probably potentially immigrant hundreds of thousands or more royalist to Taiwan, obtain citizenship within 4-8 years and wala.
Taiwan would slowly be phrased out like what happened to Hong Kong where unique family-owned shops for decades all (95%+) got phrased out.
^The devil is always in the detail... I can see why it had to be concealed from discussion at that time.. many of that president's family and even family grave is located in the mainland... and his popularity literally went from the high point of over 50% to ... single digit or under 15% even by the poll that used to favor him.
*This was an event that saw the ousting of his party from power in 2016 and when Beijing's crackdown on Hong Kong in 2019.
It also break the illusion of the 1 country 2 system Beijing was selling to Taiwan, so it switched tactics to use the military to pressure Taiwan to Submit.
O____o to Beijing's dismay; the Taiwanese responded by giving a landslide victory to the pro-democratic government for a 2nd term in 2020.

intimidation tactic probably worked really well within mainland China or nations run by military rule - it can kind of backfire on democratic nations which include those who seek it such as Ukraine.
But in the worst case that Beijing doesn't get its pick ~ it will still use the opposition to divide Taiwan so Taiwan can face internal issues without being able to completely focus on the task at hand.  This is by far the cheapest way Beijing can attempt to take Taiwan without the international backslash or war... except if it is successful.  I can imagine it would be the former Taiwanese who get sent to fight Japan :3  and S.Korea can follow.  This is why S.K. and Japan had begun saying ""Taiwna's problem is also their problem"" vice-versa and had begun working with each other despite Japan/Korea's past.",0,TRUE

First thing we need to clarify is that Japan did not ‚Äúoccupied‚Äù Taiwan, Japan has full sovereignty over Taiwan since 1895È¶¨Èóútreaty, until Japan gave up sovereignty over Taiwan at 1945. Since then Taiwan legal status is ‚Äúundecided ‚Äú, and subsequent ROC occupation government has ruled the island for 70 years without legitimacy and sovereignty over taiwan.

The most important question should be asked is that where do US stand when 23 million innocent people on the island, who has been victim of geographical power conflict for over 400 years and continued to fell under threats of either massive genocide unseen in history or slavery camp that made Xinjiang labor camp seemed naive in the future ?

Taiwan strait is not only  threshold to peace over entire pacific country union, but also the  life line of US strategic interests over half of the globe.

And let‚Äôs not forget 60% of world trade cargo go through Taiwan strait and its nearby ocean, once taiwan falls under prey of invasion, regional blockade and subsequent sanctions would easily crash down global economy, with rest of the world facing economic impact unseen in history and a unstoppable autocracy regime who wishes to replace US.",0,FALSE

I remember devices in the industrial world like super mini process control computers, Winchester Disk Drives )chassis like RAID arrays) and so forth were at $10,000 each eventually going down to 20% of that in times of inflation. (the 1980s) .

That was quite a shock since at that time TI was a leader in the production of dynamic memory.  TI never really did much with microprocessors, instead pouring their energies into DSP's and analog technologies.

They may have learned to wear Gucci suits nowadays but nothing else seem to have evolved in their psyche and consciousness from their barbarian days. Instead of recognising their sordid past and history , they celebrate their delusions like ""Thanksgiving Day"" which the Native American Indians rightly and clearly remember and commemorate as their ""Day of Mourning"" being the beginning of the murdering, genociding, plundering, stealing, raping and ultimately, OCCUPATION , of their land uninvited, without any due compensation even till today. 
But these thieves and robbers take a lot of pride in the stories they tell themselves and sell to the world how great their ""founding"" was!!! Same stories with the ""Empire"" where the sun never sets. Australia with the Aborigines. New Zealand with their Maoris. The African continent with all those Europeans...........it goes on and on. This is the 21st Century , for chrissakes! Grow up and come out of that sick and primitive mentality of never ending desire to dominate, control and subjugate. 
The zillions of dollars spent on wars and ""defence"" and the other zillions being hoarded by the 1% is more than sufficient to provide every human being on the planet a very decent and never anything wanting life on this planet with the healthiest and cleanest environment. And we pride ourselves as being the only creature on earth with the intelligence, consciousness and capacity of free will and choice. And these sick politicians choose never ending squabbles, tensions and wars!!! Go figure.

World Debt Clocks  
https://www.usdebtclock.org/world-debt-clock.html

From 1964 to 1973, the U.S. dropped more than two million tons of ordnance on Laos during 580,000 bombing missions‚Äîequal to a planeload of bombs every 8 minutes, 24-hours a day, for 9 years ‚Äì making Laos the most heavily bombed country per capita in history. The bombings were part of the U.S. Secret War in Laos to support the Royal Lao Government against the Pathet Lao and to interdict traffic along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The bombings destroyed many villages and displaced hundreds of thousands of Lao civilians during the nine-year period. 
Five years ago, the US forces, using the fake intelligence of a staged video by ‚ÄúWhite Helmets‚Äù as evidence, conducted the so-called ‚Äúmost precise air strikes in history‚Äù in Syria, killing more than 1,600 innocent civilians. In recent years, the international community has been calling for investigations into the killing of civilians in the US‚Äô overseas military operations. On Syria alone, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic pointed out several times in its reports in September 2019 and February 2021 that the US failed to distinguish military targets from civilians in its air strikes in Syria, which gravely violates international humanitarian law and may constitute war crimes. However, the US government has been turning a deaf ear to all this.‚ÄÇ 
According to reports, over the past nearly two decades, the US conducted over 90,000 air strikes in countries including Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, which may have killed up to 48,000 civilians. But the US military time and again covered up the facts and refused to apologize, admit its crimes or hold the perpetrators accountable. It did everything possible to evade its responsibilities. 
On the drone strike of civilians in Afghanistan, a Pentagon spokesperson said openly in December 2021 that no US soldiers will face disciplinary action over it. The US media also disclosed at the end of last year that from 2014 to 2019, the US military turned its guns on farmers in the middle of harvest, children playing in the streets, families fleeing the fighting and villagers taking shelter in buildings. These disastrous crimes were deliberately concealed and whitewashed. US media revealed last year that according to the US military‚Äôs own confidential assessments of more than 1,300 reports of civilian casualties, civilian casualties in US air strikes have been ‚Äúsignificantly undercounted‚Äù. Larry Lewis, a Director at the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) of the US said that on average at least one incident of civilian harm has happened every week since 9/11. 
There has been an overall pattern of negligence with regard to the US government on the issue of civilian harm. The US has also obstructed the International Criminal Court‚Äôs investigations into its war crimes in Afghanistan.‚ÄÇ Every human life, regardless of nationality, race, religion or values, is equal and precious. The US should earnestly respond to the strong call of the international community, conduct a credible, independent and impartial investigation into civilian casualties caused by US air strikes, and hold the people concerned accountable.

China has been after Formosa, now Taiwan since the communists chased the remains of the nationalists there.

They would take over one of only 2 manufacturers capable of producing the most advanced chips in the world while simultaneously cutting off the rest of the world's access to them including the only advanced weaponry capable of stopping China's ambition to rule the world.

They would also gain the expertise of every engineer and designer in Taiwan which would allow China to leapfrog ahead of the world in technology and production and they ALWAYS apply those advancements to their military.

The loss of Apple as a result has the potential to cripple the US economy and, with it, the rest of the world's economies making it that much easier for China to achieve it's world domination ambitions. Anyone who had invested in the company would lose everything. 

Do NOT underestimate China and their ambitions. They've been planning this for nearly a hundred years and have been waiting for just the right opportunity. They are in the same position that Germany and Japan were in at the start of WWII. Japan was underestimated and look what happened. No one ever thought they were capable of doing what they did and certainly not in the very short time it took them to do it, conquering nearly all of Asia in only a few months and against the defenses of nearly every major military power in the world.

Nobody can deny that DNA is a scientific 'reading of Universal identities: not only does each being, plants included, has a DNA, but a large number of swab opportunities within. No computer could match the equivalent storage of information. This recent discovery, in the public eye, is mostly associated towards control: forensic evidence gets used globally. Science gets used mainly to back a lifestyle and political agendas: if we talk about self-realisation and freedom of speech knowledge should be orientated towards promoting individual variances while having common features. Non-scientific Humanities have to play a balancing act with technology.

Many traditions, including native Cultures, divide the Universe into moieties: in relation to that approach, we are witnessing in the United States difficulties in stepping out of a dysfunctional parity in Government.

If we agree that the Universe is expanding, so should our conceptions, and stepping out of cycles in domestic and global terms seems to become a necessity

The climate keeps telling us who is in control while some Humans want to take over that role: the time has come to step out of PPP, ping pong political games and consider the wider picture while it may still be time for that.There is clearly a lot of hardship in hatching out of rigid dualities but this has to become the challenge of decades to come, or else??????",0,FALSE

As an old example, there  was a long standing battle between the speed of processing of the Z80 and 6502 processors.  The Z80 could run at 8MHz and the 6502 ran at 1Mhz.  Many believed the Z80 was therefore faster based on the single metric of clock speed.  This was false.  The 6502 used a single clock cycle to perform a read, execution, and write cycle meaning the 6502 could perform one million instructions per second.  On the other hand, the Z80 has almost no instructions  requiring less than four cycles meaning to perform the same action as the 6502 requires at least twelve cycles making the Z80 substantially slower than the 6502.

Transportation is always miserable in Taiwan, regardless of any city except for Taipei.
We use cars often, so we build road only for cars, which is a big problem that gained attention from public in recent years.

My father is currently working in one of the semiconductor equipment supplier, so TSMC fabs in Tainan is usually some of the destinations of the week before work.
Our family lives in Taichung, and he usually gets stuck in traffic jam on roads. After knowing this, I was wondering : why not just fix the traffic problem by building more convenient public transportation? We can save those smart brains from those pointless jams every day!
Well the harsh truth is, we are a group smart brain, smart but cheap‚Ä¶

Also, it is important to think about is : we lives in the democratic community, which public constructions is hard the be built by the government, since there is always a need to convince people who owns the land.

fRhfvSDyJdY,@johndoh5182,2022-08-10T04:45:17Z,"TSMC's construction site in AZ has the space for expansion.  In fact it can basically be the same as 6 fabs, or maybe in reference to terms used here, 6 stages.  I think N5 is going to be really big so I'm betting TSMC creates 2 N5 and variants of N5 there, and then they probably build N3 capacity there because THAT node is going to be bigger than N5.  And, in case people are wondering how I'm saying this, N5 actually has a cost advantage over N7 unless TSMC raises prices too much.  It's an excellent node with a good balance of frequency range and power scaling along that frequency range and it's a bit better than N7.  It's a node that many companies can use for a step down from HPC products once HPC moves off of N5.  N3 on the other hand is going to be a premiere node, outstanding power savings for low to medium speed devices and TSMC knows it has to clock very fast for HPC.  I don't know what it's going to look like at high frequencies because I don't know of examples of it out in the wild.  On the other hand N5 is now out of risk production with the original risk partners and moving into wide scale adaption, with AMD said to be the biggest customer for N5, based on current contracts.  If it's just as good as N5 at very high frequencies like 5.5GHz then N3 is going to be sufficient for many years for that class of electronics right below HPC.

HPC always moves to the most advanced node.  Companies HAVE to do this to get a competitive edge.  You can look as Apple products.  Their new M2 laptops can run at full speed when switched to battery power.  That's REALLY impressive, and the battery lasts a long time running heavy loads.  And that's using an advanced N5 node, N5P.  They were supposed to be on N3, but N3 isn't ready for risk partners until next year.  I would have thought they would have moved to N4, but I guess N5P is giving excellent performance at frequencies Apple uses which is slower than Intel and AMD, while using little power.

The next step down is N2.  It's possible that even N2 could make it into that AZ complex.  This is the point where probably TSMC goes with the naming format Intel is using, off of nanometer and onto angstrom.  So, the step down from N2 is not N1, that jump is dramatic, so N2 will probably get a name based on angstrom so maybe N20A.  The next node will probably be N17A or N18A.

And here we get into all kinds of physics problems and really just how fast the fabs need to move to smaller nodes.  The efficiency of a 2nm or 20A node is going to be FAR superior to to current N7 or N5 based devices, or in the case of Samsung with their JUST releases devices, 4nm.  It's going to be at the point where a laptop can run a heavy load on battery for many hours.  Right now for instance, Apple M2 based systems will run a heavy load (all-core loads) ON battery and it doesn't reduce clock frequency so it's still consuming the same amount of power.  Apple didn't see the need to drop the frequency to conserve battery.  It's on N5P.  The systems it was compared to was a Zen 3+ laptop and an Intel 12th gen laptop.  They had to drop the frequency to conserve power.  AMD is on TSMC N6 and Intel is on their Intel 7 node.  But 20A is going to use SO little power and the transistor density SO great that once there, Intel, Samsung and TSMC can focus on improving the quality along with coming out with similar size nodes but different characteristics for a wide variety of use cases and I expect that once HPC has moved to N3, there's going to be a slowdown in replacing equipment because of the power savings.  So purchasing is going to slow once we're at N3 and 20A.

HPC based on those nodes could include CPUs that could theoretically have 300 - 500 cores, a SINGLE CPU. N5 is going to allow AMD to produce server CPUs that are 128 cores/256 threads.  But, this is almost full X86-64 cores.  Once the move is made to big-little and AMD figures out the right ISA and can reduce core size to 1/4 that of a full X86-64 core with all the advanced features, even that 128 core CPU could now be 512 cores if it was ALL little cores, on N5!!!!

So N3 and 20A are going to allow HPC to advance to almost unimaginable performance capability.  The problem becomes the rest of the hardware platform.  Do you have enough memory channels for that many cores, is there enough data bandwidth into and out of the CPU.  I'd say power is an issue, but each drop in transistor size comes with reduced power, and if AMD can make a 128 SMT core CPU on N5, then surely they could make a 500+ core monster on N3 using big-little of some type, mostly little cores if they can figure out a memory scheme to deal with that many cores.  And if not on N3, they can easily do it with 20A.

fRhfvSDyJdY,@ideastshoa6383,2022-08-10T02:10:35Z,"@@Leshic2 I don't know about the flags.  There have been several countries setting up governments in Taiwan.  At the beginning there were Dutch in southern Taiwan (i.e. Tainan) and Spanish in northern Taiwan (Tamsui.  Spanish fort is still there too.  It's an even more popular tourist point than the Dutch fort in Tainan).  Then Chinese Ming dynasty in Tainan.  Then Qing dynasty in Tainan.  But all these governments only ruled part of Taiwan, not the whole island.  In 1895 Japan established the first government that really governed the whole island.

After WWII USA defeated Japan (and Japan gave up owning Taiwan) but didn't want to govern Taiwan (not sure if they regret about that now) and asked KMT in China to ""manage"" Taiwan for its convenience.  Then KMT lost the Chinese civil war and fled to Taiwan and accidentally created a rather complicated situation now.  But a basic reality is People's Republic of China never rules Taiwan even for one second.  Therefore the so called re-unification is a fake issue.  How can one reunify with something that was never part of it?

That is, Russia has scientists who understand how to create a lithograph, and since the government began to finance this industry, it is likely that something will be created. Of course, this will not cancel the lag, but the ASML will also lose the contribution that Russian specialists made. In the West, they really don't like to mention this, but brains from Russia participated in many scientific and technological achievements - the same Large Hadron Collider or the International Space Station. After the imposition of sanctions, Russia was able to create its own composites for aviation in a short time, replace aircraft navigation equipment, and much more. Ultimately, ultra-small chips are not needed for an aircraft or a car, so even if 30 nm is reached, most of the needs of the economy will be covered.

If anyone thinks that Russia's technological gap is limited to IC / micro-electronics, they are very much mistaken. Russia's technological gap is endemic. The F22 was designed in the 1980s and built in the 1990s when feature size was still measured in microns (1000s of nano-meters). The space shuttle was designed in the 70s and built in the 80s, when feature size was 10s of microns. If Russia had the material science, design engineering, systems integration, logistics, administration and business planning skills at an internationally competitive level, and the only thing that they lacked was an IC industry capable of producing <65nm components, they would still be capable of producing incredible, internationally competitive products in the military, scientific or consumer domains. However, they don't. It's a mistake to think that just because the Soviet Union excelled in some of those areas (e.g. material science), that Russia retained those skills. They didn't. The industrial sector collapsed after 1991. All capable professionals left to pursue a better life abroad. The political system which formed after 1991 made it hostile to everything but the most rudimentary industry (e.g. natural resource extraction). There is almost no secondary or tertiary industry left in Russia, and the service sector is laughable. The attempts to kick-start these industries (like the companies talked about in this video) serve a two-fold purpose - to show on national TV that ""we can be independent from the West"" and to steal money from government contracts and then declare bankruptcy without actually shipping anything. It's a game they play at the higher levels of government in Russia, and have been playing for a long time.",2,FALSE

N_4R4X7AWtU,@clutteredchicagogarage2720,2022-12-26T05:02:09Z,"I'm going to throw out a bunch of unrelated thoughts. 

(1) I don't know enough about chip fab equipment to be able to gauge whether, for example, the Russian regime could bribe a company in (e.g.,) India to help them import some key equipment (e.g., originally from ASML) in violation of sanctions to help them advance their chip-making. I believe that they will likely try.

(2) Since the Trump government in the USA increased sanctions against China, I've started to wonder if these sanctions could hasten RiscV research in China (and also Russia). I haven't followed this closely, but it appears that other people who follow RiscV R&D closely also believe that this is possible. Just as Linux, due to being truly open source, transitioned from a niche hobby + research OS to overtake proprietary Unix operating systems in usage, I think it's possible that RiscV's adoption could exceed ARM's in 15 years. In the west, I read that Google is investing in RiscV R&D pretty heavily, and I believe Chinese companies will inevitably continue to advance RiscV adoption as well. I think it's possible that millions of android phones could run on RiscV within a few years -- especially in China.

(3) As you said, Russia doesn't need < 20nm computers to manufacture weapons systems. I wholeheartedly hope that sanctions against Russia will make it impossible for the country to ramp up manufacturing of all computerized weapons systems (modern tanks with night-vision and superior aiming technology, new military aircraft, various kinds of missile and rocket systems, etc), but I think that Russia will probably be able to evade sanctions to be able to get microprocessors for equipment that doesn't need many chips. I'd suspect that new aircraft will be difficult to manufacture, but, unfortunately, I think Russia will still be able to make many kinds of military systems by evading sanctions on limited stocks of components obtained from unsanctioned countries.

(4) As a software developer, I've been impressed by software developers in Russia that have excelled in developing highly efficient open source server software. The nginx web server and ClickHouse are a couple examples. I am speculating here, but I believe that computer science education in Russia developed an emphasis on efficient coding in C/C++ at least in part because the performance of computers available in Russia has historically been behind the performance of computers available in the USA or western Europe. I also have a theory that the grammatical structure of slavic languages, in which the declension of nouns and adjectives allows reordering of the subject, verb and object in sentences without loss of meaning, also helps slavic programmers learn functional languages and higher-order functions. This is, I believe, the same reason that reverse-polish notation in math was developed by a Polish mathematician since it is is not unnatural or uncommon for Polish (or Russian or Ukrainian, etc) speakers to express certain ideas in Verb-subject-object order.",1,FALSE

Most of the economy extracts minerals, processes the proceeds and transports the resources into other countries. Where the hell are they suppose to use this sophisticated tech? Even robotic arms do not require smaller semiconductors than the ones they already produce. Apart from bank cards, the only other large scale application of these could be surveillance cameras that are to be used in big cities. May be car industry. But that is not a big market at all.

The West biggest disfavor to itself was calling the Soviet Union: ""Russia"" interchangeably.
Where I grew up, we NEVER did it - ever - not even by mistake. (in Europe)
This muddled their heads, still(!) confusing the two. 

Proper choice and usage of words SHAPES thinking. Most don't know that (but should).

So when Russia is mentioned, they AUTOMATICALLY revert in their minds to the Soviet Union with all of its troubles, characteristics and shortcomings. It's a TRAP in thinking.

Today's massive failure of the West in handling Russia shows it with absolute clarity, the dumbness and delusion - thinking it's the old doddering Soviet Union. Bad imprinting through language... 
 
There are STILL tens of millions of people in the West, who think and are convinced that Russia is Communist- - and it all goes back to the careless and ultimately stupid routine interchanging in the daily language the Soviet Union and Russia.

This chip argument is a red herring. Russia builds better weapons than the US - where direct comparison is possible. (Russia needs no aircraft Carriers - so that's a useless argument - but it builds better(!) missiles and subs in EVERY category - yup, that is a fact - except you are not being told). 
Consumer technology comes from China, both to the US and to Russia, so that's irrelevant. The US bought Russian rocket motors for well over a decade; the Russians stopped selling them to the US since the new (March) sanctions. 

Wake up... I spoke to people who spent time in Russia. some even speak some Russian. They are/were shocked how advanced they are; they all went with the notion of ""it's the (backward, doddering) Soviet Union/Russia without the Soviet Union name.""

FYI: Russia weapons MUST be 100% Russian-made and sourced. 100% - including the chips.

Now that the business climate has changed with the Russia sanctions and also the Chinese sanctions by the US, both China and Russia will have to bite the bullet and start their own home ground semiconductor manufacturing and the best part is that they have to do it and succeed otherwise they will be even more behind in technology. 
Another approach is to move away from silicon substrates into maybe graphite which than is a more leveling playing field for both China and Russia.
But time will tell how this plays out but suffice to say, both Russia and China has to succeed otherwise they will forever be at the mercy of US sanctions.
So its not why Russia cant replace TSMC that shouldn't even be the question because TSMC is uncatchable and no foundry in the world has been able to catchup to TSMC given their extremely aggressive customer driven sales strategy to work with their customers and provide their foundry services with fantastic yields!

Russia failing to compete with the US, EU and China in latest tech equipment will mean they will have far lower compute power.
This will mainly limit their AI training, science research and maybe server capabilities.
Missiles do not use general purpose cpus.
Missiles and most equipment of any kind nowdays use ""ASIC"" chips (Application-specific integrated circuit). ASIC chips are usualy far cheaper and more performant on the one thing they are designed to do. They also use far less power and have near to no bugs-crashes-failures. ASICs put on missiles usualy are at a higher lithography for many reasons:
1) lower cost
2) resistance to noise, more reliable in factories or aplications with too much noise (a military missile)
3) heat is far more easily dealt with, no heatsinks or coolers required

In case to produse a decent ASIC you need:
1) Highly skilled engineers
2) Fabs to produse
3) A large amount of devices using them

Most of the cost of an ASIC product goes to the software and hardware engineering because they are very specific to the application and cannot be used in any other device.
If you fail to get a large production of the final product then your ""design cost"" went to waste.

Here is a short explanation of BAE and why they use ASICs, note that BAE refer to asics as SOCs, this means that system memore (RAM), storage (SSD) and other parts of a normal computer are all inside the chip (with very small capcities, just enough to do the specific job):
https://www.baesystems.com/en-us/definition/what-are-asics",4,FALSE
N_4R4X7AWtU,@deang5622,2022-07-16T12:03:19Z,"A lot of what you say about ASICs is rubbish. I used to design them.

The cost of an ASIC is dominated by three things: the NRE charge that has to be paid up front to the ASIC vendor to cover the design validation and layout, pre and post layout simulations, generation of automatic test data if the customer has requested it, and the fabrication and testing of the engineering samples.

All this is done before full scale production occurs.
The second factor is chip testing and burn-in for military applications which isn't done for consumer products.

The third factor is the physical size of the chip, the die itself.

The military market is much smaller in terms of the number of chips they buy compared to the consumer product market, so they don't manufacturer as many chips, so that NRE charge is spread over a smaller production quantity of chips meaning the unit price per chip becomes higher.",2,TRUE

        Yes, TSMC is currently printing out the majority of the worlds semiconductor chips, but it‚Äôs only because the most important technology company, has allowed it to happen.
         What has awakened the sleeping giant, Intel, is the enormous capital TSMC has been able to raise when it realized that so many chip design companies had either completely stopped manufacturing chips, or merely stopped reinvesting capital into chip manufacturing, that the world had a severe shortage in chips, and TSMC could name their price. Although the issue was a shortage of chips, the largest driver was the fact that all the new technologies were utilizing more and more chips. 
          Once chips were on everyone‚Äôs mind, a sense of doom took over as most everyone could see how we were all standing on the precipice because of the insecurity in the industry. China could invade Taiwan, and take control TSMC. The commercial semiconductor manufacturing industry would be hit hard, beyond description. The real Devil in the Deal is up against the military, as everything manufactured, military included, is designed to use more and more chips.
           The industry responded, though. The shortage of chips, and therefore the price bulge, will remain significant long enough to assure a bloated return on capital investment in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. 
            Intel is building several semiconductor fabs in the US, and are projected to be online in time for carving out its share of the inflated price.
            TSMC is building new chip manufacturing facilities here in Phoenix, safe from China and anyone else who finds their current enormous profits to be too much of a temptation.
            IT WILL PASS. WE ARE SAFE. Stop with all the, ‚Äò‚ÄúSky is falling,‚Äù nonsense, will you?

1) Rosnano finances a company that is supposed to create something, say a microprocessor (see Elbrus and Baikal).
2) Some work is being done, while the company that got financed (and the whole hierarchy of people that stands between that company and Rosnano) is slowly stealing money from the allocated budget. Maybe not the whole ""company"" is stealing, but rather ""some people in that company"".
3) People in the company who steal those money pay back to Rosnano to keep them happy so they don't compain and don't dig in to find out why the progress on the project is so slow or why nothing gets done. 
4) At the end, even if the product design is finished (which is rare), the small batch gets produced (say, 50 microprossesors).
5) The journalists film it and show it on central TV channels with a lot of bullshit like ""Russian scientists have produced a cutting-edge superpowerful microprocessors. USA has nothing like it and will be buying from us because they don't have a choice. Russian science and microelectronics are the most powerful now"", etc.... 
6) Rosnano reports to the higher management (government) that the final product has been developed and produced.
7) Everybody is happy.

So what's the result of all this? In most cases nothing ever gets created or produced. Even if it does, it's going to be a small amount of product (for example, 50 microprossesors) just to show that ""something was done"", but in 99% of cases this stage wont' even happen (nevermind mass production). And what happens to the budget of the project (millions of US dollars)? See above.

You might ask: why does Russian government keep spending money on those dead projects if nothing gets done anyway? Because, as I mentioned before, the government itself is a participator in the corruption and money stealing. Creating something is not the main priority here, but rather to receive a big budget and then steal it while pretending to be doing something useful.

You may say AI or supercomputing but let's say if 65nm is 25x less efficient than leading edge 7nm, what's stopping them from building a computer 50x bigger and more power hungry (after all, energy efficiency is not a concern for them). Russians are experts at overcoming technological disadvantages with brute force. 

From an economics perspective every leading edge node after 14nm has not dramatically reduced performance per unit price.

N_4R4X7AWtU,@RayTsou,2022-08-08T09:44:38Z,"I vaguely have an EE background but to answer your question ""what's stopping them from building a bigger chip"" is basically latency.

So when people refer to Xnm fab process, what it traditionally refers to is the gate length, or the distance from the source to drain within a transistor. When the gate is ON, current flows from source to drain and once there is enough charge in the drain, the transistor is read as a 1. Now the longer the gate is, the longer it takes for the transistor to read as a 1 after flipping it on. This basically sets a theoretically threshold on how fast an entire chip can run. When you build a bigger chip, you're chaining more transistors and actually increase the total latency of the entire circuit. You end up with a less responsive circuit, you have to increase complexity to handle the timing issues that arise, and you also lower yields since bigger chip means less chips per wafer.

Also note, engineers tend to aim to shrink the gate length and width by ~70% every 2 years, which decreases the area of the gate by ~50%. Combine this with setting the electromagnetic field such that electron velocity holds constant, you can effectively double the speed of transistors. This is how Moore's Law is achieved. So 65nm * 0.7^6 =~ 7nm, meaning 65nm is at least 2^6=64X slower than 7nm.",4,TRUE

One day, they got the word that Brezhnev was coming to visit and see the progress. They did not have a chip. They took a photo of an Intel chip and reduced it to a very small size. They put it under a microscope and let Brezhnev look at it. He rose from the chair and smiled, invigorated, he said, ‚ÄúWonderful. We will beat the Americans.‚Äù

That said, rough times usually lead to innovation and who knows what kind of new CPUs we'll see coming from Russia, based on ARM or RISC-V.

And only after 2014, when Russia decided that we need to depend less on imports, only after our government started to support our microelectronics industry, we have started to see some new tech that can be considered relevant.

So I'd argue that there's a need in more strict control, especially now, when Russia desperately needs its own manufacturing and not just developments.

Basically, politics steered and shaped the industry for some agenda.

Re-branding imports (finished products) as domestic products is fraud, which should be illegal everywhere. So this is not what I meant by control.

Russian elites are a mafia, in how they operate in who they are. This is simply a fact, read ""Putin's Kleptocracy, Who owns Russia?"" for some fun details.
Mafia is too crude to operate complex structures like idk, modern semi-conductor manufacturing. That's why Russia's export stuck at the most primitive level of get things of the ground (using western technology, often on fields that were discovered back in USSR)
At the same time they can barely tolerate smart people as those would inevitably become alternate centers of power, undermining mafia. Especially if they, lets say create succesful high-tech buiseness.

This is because human beings in their natural state are leisure-loving. Unless they're under a constant external stimulus (fear in particular), they don't perform to their max limit. This is why historically the fastest innovations took place in do-or-die situations (war times).

If we look at the current day high pressure corporate environment and the culture of ""grind"" and ""crunch"" etc, with strong armed authoritarian top down management style (the favored style in neoliberal capitalistic ""free world"" corporations) we see an uncomfortable similarity to fascist authoritarian top down structures. Yet, this model is the most commonly followed and successful (a.k.a ""profitable"") in almost all high value tech, media and innovation companies in USA and its subordinates. With ever diminishing wages, worker rights, holidays, benefits, prison work (a.k.a slavery) and union busting ranging from sneaky to downright violent being the accepted norm, it has pushed the collective productivity higher than ever before.",10,TRUE

I agree that PRC will be the main source of supply replace sanctioned supply. As a Strategic Partner, China is motivated to help Russia be as strong as it can .. without sacrificing it's own interests.
I anticipated  TMC chip sanctions and in my reading I came across 2 points not mentioned here that can soften the impact of chip sanctions.
 1) Russia has long declared chips Military Strategic items and has unregistered chips fabs inbedded in classified military/Aerospace institutions. Obviously what help they can offer the wider Russian Industry is unknown as they are classified but analysts have said the RU Gov has been preparing to upscale these production lines in anticipation of chip sanctions since 2014
2) The type of chips Russia is most dependent on. Russia is not a producer of many bleeding edge electronics, ie phones, graphics cards, supercomputers. Most of the chips required by Russian manufacturers are for heavy industry; Resource Extraction, Energy, Agri-tech, Heavy vehicles (Rail/Shipping). So that reduces the dependency on the highend chips TMC produces. (But the Russian Tech start up sector, like YANDEX, will suffer) 
YES Chip sanctions are going to impact, set back and force Russia to restratergise how it produces electronics.
But chips are probably the least of Russian Industries probs. It has suddenly found itself cut off from Western markets.

But I don't think there's that much money in chips, just do the math:  300M chips a year * $450 a chip (best guess for the avg price of a retail processor chip) = $135B USD of revenue.  That's peanuts (Volkswagen auto group alone makes about $250B a year).  Triple this number for all other chips and that's still only about $400B a year.  At the end of the day, chips are great for geeks but the real money is still being a gatekeeper (doctor, lawyer, businessman who buys low and sells high).",1,FALSE

One thing I‚Äôve been wondering about is what happens to fabs when the leading edge customer move on to the next node? Presumably TSMC (and Samsung/Intel/Global Foundries) built huge capacity at 12/16/28nm. But those nodes are no longer good enough for products that need the leading edge. There‚Äôs always stuff that doesn‚Äôt need leading edge, but I always assumed that all those products were being made on old mature nodes where it would be cost prohibitive (with little economic benefit) to transition to newer process nodes. Also, what is the global demand situation for all those use cases beyond the leading edge? It seems like there would have to be pretty significant demand growth to absorb the entire manufacturing capacity of a new process node every every 2-3 years. We know the demand is there for leading edge, but what about older nodes. Specifically, as TSMC transitions to 3nm (primarily Apple to start) and more customers like AMD & nVidia move more production to 5nm, what happens to all of TSMC‚Äôs 7nm capacity if it‚Äôs no longer being used for GPU‚Äôs and desktop/laptop CPU‚Äôs? Who‚Äôs taking all that capacity?",34,FALSE
TvEk6QsNuRA,@villageidiot8194,2022-03-08T03:13:36Z,"I think its going to be used in chips for cars, for the infotainment system, dishwashers, TVs, and other appliances",15,TRUE
TvEk6QsNuRA,@excitedbox5705,2022-03-08T05:47:49Z,"They market those nodes to other customers. Apple got 5nm first but the year after AMD and Nvidia will use that node. Also makes sense because mobile chips are smaller and the yield for the much larger GPU and CPU chips will be better after the node is more mature. Flaws are usually calculated on a per area basis which is also why AMD chiplets gave them such an advantage, since a smaller chip has less chance of failure and if something goes wrong it is less to throw away.

Older nodes are still useful for other chips though. Lots of analog and mixed signal ICs are made on larger nodes because you would burn through the traces with so much current otherwise. Keysight oscilloscope ASICs for example were being made on nodes over 100nm (130nm in the 4th gen Infiniivision) but now went with a 65nm node recently. The lower cost of using an ASIC also allows them to use the same chip in many product lines. You can buy a $1000 scope with the same chip as their $50,000 or $1 million scopes. The higher tier ones use multiple chips together, while the base models share 1 chip for multiple channels.",10,TRUE
TvEk6QsNuRA,@Fiercesoulking,2022-03-08T11:09:27Z,Like in the videos said a lot of nodes get upgraded those who weren't end up the with the stuff said from @Village also there are other manufactures who can't under 20 nm those are specialist in doing chips for other uses then computer.

1. Purchasing at $120 was about 20% above intrinsic value thus odds were against you in the short term and profits would be smaller in the long term. 

2. Purchasing a stock and not wanting it to go down. If it does then selling eg after pushing through a support line. You just stated this was a good company and were happy to pay $120 for it. I didn‚Äôt hear you say what was wrong with the stock with price movement trend downwards. Nothing has really changed in the short term except for price volatility. If you were happy at $120 then at $100 you can increase your ownership at a better price. 

My assumption is your day trading. If that‚Äôs the case you need to make another trade with +20% profit to catchup. 

Personally I think the trade didn‚Äôt work because you paid too much and/or your time frame was too short. I‚Äôd much rather be down on a great company like this and ride it out then day trading something else to try recoup my loss.

They only started with the LHR version because they got caught selling to miners and received backlash from gamers. Miners will pay exorbitant prices to get GPU because ETH mining has been very profitable - especially when you stake ETH after the merge and earn passive income. Nvida knows this and it is no coincidence that the most expensive card 3090 didn't have an LHR lock.

Without a doubt, Nvidia's past sales were inflated because the ETH price exploded. That is why scalpers had their heyday with pricing Nividia GPU at exorbitant prices on eBay. They weren't targeting gamers at those prices; they were chasing after miners. 

There is no coincidence that Nvidia GPU had a larger shortage than AMD's GPU, despite AMD being cheaper and equally competent in gaming. 

Now miners are dumping their cards before the merge is complete. Gamers can buy used cards from miners directly - taking new sales away from Nvidia.

Most (probably all) streams and rivers in Taiwan are dangerously polluted, with high levels of lead and hepatitis and plastics and who knows what else. Its estimated that over 90% of Taiwanese have been infected with hepatitis. Most homes in Taiwan have no sanitation system, so waste is dumped straight to rivers or the ocean. Burning of huge mounds of waste is the main method that Taiwan is using to dispose of waste. Of course, the air quality is really bad because of it. Taiwan is trying to work towards improving their pollution and waste regulations, but its been slow going. Growth and $$$ is always #1.",1,FALSE

But if they still fall for the scheme after so many warnings being revealed by concerned international citizens of the shady actions of US government then they deserved it! 

If those TSMC bigwigs have an once of brain they would cut their losses and move on from their pipe dream of moving to Arizona! You may be losing $25 billion now, but it is still better than losing your entire business and livelihood to the scamming USA! Answer this simple question for me: If water shortage has become so bad in Arizona that either TSMC or Intel has to shut down operations, which one do you think the US government would force to shut down its business operations? Now that you understand my drift, do you think it is a good idea to be the second fiddle in every decision that the US government makes?

Technology and quality control are equally important. Most of the quality control are related to the staff commitment. Cheung, the previous chairman of TSMC said once that the cost of making the chips in US would be at least 50 pct more expensive than in Taiwan (RoC). Micron has a fab in the northern part of Singapore, near the border with Malaysia, as its workers mostly from Malaysia who commute daily. US workers would probably like local works here do not see the jobs working for TSMC very challenging and promising. In my early days of my career, I was in the transistor radio factory, and Hong Kong was the world's No 1 maker of transistor ratio - even a high school boy would have known how to make a transistor ratio, not much technological advancement indeed, but not everyone knows how to do that on a commercial scale, enough to make a profit. BTW, the leader of Taiwan (RoC) Tsai claims to have a doctorate from LSE, but cannot provide the documental evidence. I believe that both MI6 and CIA must have access to the archives of LSE, and Tsai must have long been held hostage by US. This perhaps explains why she could not possibly have not protected TSMC. And the shareholders of TSMC are equally powerless, to see the shares dropping like rock. And Taiwan (RoC) does not have a moral obligation to protect these foreign shareholders either, do they?",15,FALSE

In Pennsylvania, the state gave them some land and kicked in the money to build, well there are empty buildings now for whatever reason. Then our past Governor invited them here to Wisconsin, the state enacted imminent domain on farms land, and homes, and they built streets and infrastructure plus again a few buildings. Of course, I knew it was a BS campaign gimmick promising 13,000 jobs with a company on their business statement stating within a few years totally automated. They needed water and so much so that taking that much from the ground was out, next they proposed building a pipeline from Lake Michigan but there's a three-state pact not allowing that EVER. Foxxcon went from a 10 Billion dollar investment to 675 million. Here's the kicker, China built all the infrastructure for Foxxcon and a ten-year plan, they build it and ten years with no taxes the ten years were coming up, and then skipped out. Guess what they're still in China. My prediction a lot of technology that needs such a water-intensive production model will eventually run into problems along with the pollution it creates, not because of the country's rules it will get to the point clean water is getting scarcer by the day and even greed can't override what's needed for humans to survive. Another thing since I'm writing a book of predictions, electric vehicles will be in demise because of shortages of material to build them but I was talking with friends that are on fire and rescue, they have been taught to not use the jaws of life on an electric vehicle because a spark could induce an explosion and if they're burning just let them burn because water will make lithium batteries to again explode.",1,FALSE

As a result of the sanctions placed in Russia  by the west more specifically the European Union, Russia needed to reroute it's oil supply, to do this they turned to China and India and gave them oil at a relatively cheap price around 60 dollars per barrel, so in theory this would benefit Chinese manufacturing because the cost of energy would be cheaper.
However, the real reason why China would assist Russia is because of the Taiwan issue, the Chinese has always maintained the stance that Taiwan is a part of China, and with the recent events of Nancy Pelosi visiting Taiwan and doing all but recognizing it as it's own independent country, the Chinese relationship with the west isn't particularly the strongest as well. It's the old adage of 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend'.

Something you should have mentioned when it comes to AMD vs Nvidia in software and AI computing:  AMD has launched 'GPUFORT' which is an open source attempt against CUDA.  AMD's hardware is certainly capable of doing these tasks.  When it comes to creation software, hardware support has been added to UE5 and Blender for recent gen AMD GPUs.  They're not as fast the RTX 3000 series, but they give very usable performance.  This is probably because the software is still new and hasn't had time to be optimized yet.
When it comes to scientific computing and AI, the problem is that CUDA is proprietary and that's what most of the software has been written for.  But AMD has created the open source solution GPUFORT as an alternative.  Competition is always a good thing, and AMD realizes they need to compete in these markets as well.

p1m0pc5TkNw,@korana6308,2022-08-23T18:37:30Z,"Hi Tom, as a long time channel subscriber and someone who follows Russian micro electronics quite well, I would like to clarify a few things ... Boy, there were alot of misconception and misunderstanding in this video about Russian semi conductor industry and about Russia in general, but for the sake of it, let's just try keep it at microelectronics... 

Currently Russia is capable of producing 65nm at Mikron fabs in Zelenograd near Moscow, and is working towards a 45nm node, however for the types of products that they are producing, they don't need the most advanced stuff, and many people are missing that point. You need a cutting edge node mainly for the consumer sector to survive in a capitalistic consumer market ...but in fact for the military it's quite the opposite, as you would rather have a more reliable tech node (that consumes more power ,yet is powerful enough for it's intended operation) but is less so prone to damage or electromagnetic manipulations/ interference, and Russia fully produces those types of products - chips and there are no shortages on anything that would make the production of those types of chips decline.

Also it is a huge understatement to say that Russia had no expertise back in the Soviet era or now ,or that it didn't produce anything technologically worthwhile back in the Soviet era as that is a complete lie. The exponential growth of semiconductor industry happened exactly in the 90s with PCs ,Mobile Phones and consoles... and Soviet Union would have had the same consumer products or even better ones than Intel , if not for it's dissolution (i.e Russia already had the most successful gaming consoles like tetris, or ""volk i yaica"" from electroniks and it's clones...) Most of the Soviet technology is just simply unknown to the west (Just like how now you almost don't know anything about China, while they are making huge leaps in tech. development every year). For example the most famous Soviet Autonomous Space Shuttle program Buran , which have  had even a new largest plane in the world developed specifically just for it (An 225) , which was capable of autonomous landing a space shuttle with it's Soviet era Computers back in the 80s... In fact USSR had lots of technological advancements most of which were hidden behind it's military and space tech, which was even greater than it's western counterparts (same for the west btw, internet developed out of the military tech, same now for Russia btw too) ... Most of it ,by the way, was stolen by the Americans , and not vice versa as your video would have suggested, like the shuttle program - Buran, or the Yak 141 (vertical take off jet plane) like the F35 etc... 

To give you an example of one of those people standing behind those soviet era CPU developments is - Boris Babayan which was later hired by Intel , as he and his team had greatly helped Intel with their CPUs development and encryptions... So there would have been an even better CPU, if all of those smart Soviet people were put to good use in the 90s , and if the Soviet Union didn't collapse ...and there would have been some great consumer CPUs for sure... But... it is what it is. The point is that ,Russia has had , back in the Soviet days ,and still has the expertise and institutes ,and more importantly people , to develop and produce high tech semiconductor products and chips , and even nodes, which for some reason western people always underestimate...

One of those Russian processors that Boris Babayan had also worked on during his days was the Elbrus CPUs (and it's micro architecture)... which is another topic that hasn't been talked about much in the west at all, and that CPU actually greatly improves with each generation , as it roughly doubles it's performance with each gen... They are however ofcourse not licensed to have a x86 architecture, so they are developed mainly for the Linux based systems and for specific data computation and analyzing tasks... However their integrated transcoder is capable of running a x86 just fine ( with some loss in perf. for transcoding ofcourse). As a VLIW architecture it was developed for the different task in mind, and in those specific tasks it is already faster than Intel. However there's this youtube channel called"" Elbrus PC Play "" as those enthusiast guys (streams are in Russian) have already been running it on Windows 10 on an old (10 year old) Elbrus PC with Radeon R9 370 4GB Graphics. ( as Russian Elbrus only has an integrated 2D Graphics , so they need an AMD GPU to play games)... And modern games actually already ran at playable FPS (even with 30% to 60% loss of perf. due to transcode decryption, which in theory could be improved). However with it's newer version of Elbrus 16C and a modern GPU I would expect that modern games would be able to run at 30 - 60 fps. no problem (with potentially natively programmed games, i.e. in a console scenario, they will get even more FPS than intel or AMD... but that scenario (of a console) is extremely unlikely to occur) . The beauty is ofcouse is that everything was designed and developed in Russia and is going to come to the consumer market too eventually (technically it is already) ... yet their next gen Elbrus 32C will be even better and could in theory become a competitor to Intel and AMD... at least in the Russian and CIS + allies market in theory... 300+ mil people ). (There are also other Russian CPUs like Baikal, but they all have ARM cores in them , only Elbrus has a fully unique Russian core.)

And the caveat is ofcourse is that those chips manufacturing is outsourced to the TSMC's fab at Taiwain as it is on a 14nm node. And also the CPU is quite expensive with a 16C expected to be up to $10 grand USD, as it's main purpose is for the governmental and scientific work and it is not produced in large quantities yet . But it is one of the examples of the Russian technological semiconductor designs development, which was unfairly skimped on, to say the least, in this video.

I love the China's gonna collapse because of the real estate sector. Because anyone who's been paying attention knows this was a situation created by Chinese regulators trying to rein in the real estate sector. Anyone who's paid attention knows that American short sellers have been calling out Chinese property developers for being ponzi schemes since 2005. They tried to rein them in but then the 2008 crisis happened and they turned on the stimulus which only made the property developers an even larger ponzi scheme and doing things like buying soccer teams and airlines. The property sector debt situation was created by Chinese regulators continuously forcing banks to limit lending to the too big to fail property developers. They could've simply kept the game going as they did during the last 15 years since the 2008 crisis. Tom's viewers dont seem to understand that banks in China are all government-owned and controlled. This is why they have reined in the real estate sector after 2008 as they told the banks to keep on lending to the too big to fail developers. Anyone who's seen social media in China knows that the lack of affordable housing is a major concern and the CCP fears it will destabilize them which is why their trying to cool the sector down as it's highly speculative and actually let working class people afford homes.,0,FALSE

Mostly small family farms growing very high quality organic vegetables and even grains.  First, find an area of tundra that has access to a water source.  Second, the insulation cap needs to be removed to expose the frozen soil so that sunlight can access and thaw it enough to till.  That means first removing the shrub and brush covering the soil, allow the Sun to thaw the top soil, then it will be ready for tilling.  Then add mulched tundra plants, compost, and other natural fertilizer such as manure or fish.

p1m0pc5TkNw,@cassius_eu5970,2022-08-23T15:43:21Z,"Taiwan is a multi-faceted issue but there are two main reasons for why the PRC wants to reunify with Taiwan. 

First, every Chinese knows the century of humiliation that China suffered from the Opium War to 1949. Nearly all the historical vestiges of this century of humiliation have been removed or resolved, including Hong Kong and Macau.

Only one remains: Taiwan. It was Chinese territory until China was forced to hand it to Japan after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. The Chinese have been disappointed by the US several times on Taiwan. At the end of World War I, when China thought it had worked with the US, it initially received assurance from the US and the British that Taiwan would be returned to China at the Versailles Peace Conference. The Chinese were told that the territories would be restored to the young republic, as a reward for the efforts of the nearly 100,000 Chinese workers who had been sent to the front in Europe to assist the British and French. But the territories were awarded instead to Japan. The Americans and British turned out to have made simultaneous secret agreements with both China and Japan, and China felt enormously deceived by that.

This history has taught the Chinese not to accept American assurances. Any move by the US to support, directly or indirectly, the secession of Taiwan from China brings back this historical memory. It provokes a strong, powerful, and virulent national reaction, which boxes in any Chinese leader who may be trying to look for room to manoeuvre. And the US cannot claim that it doesn‚Äôt understand the significance of Taiwan. It was clearly the hottest issue to resolve when Nixon and Kissinger began the process of reconciliation with China. Many clear understandings were reached between America and China. The most explicit understanding reached was that Taiwan and China belonged to one country, and that the government of the PRC is the legitimate government of that country.

Second, there are also the strategic considerations: Taiwan blockaded the PRC for 30+ years under ROC port closure policy (with US assent). There were over 140 incidents where Taiwan was threatening and intercepting trade vessels, including international ones, right off the PRC coast and within the PRC's national waters. The only reason why Taiwan isn't doing that anymore is because the PRC is far stronger now. But Taiwan has proven to be too much of a security liability (especially as a US asset) for the PRC to ignore.",1,FALSE

Because the chips are built on different nodes, their sizes will be different, i.e. TSMC's numbers are per-transistor, or per-architectural-unit, not per-die-size. Performance per die size isn't necessarily correlated with performance per transistor when you're comparing GPUs with wildly different architectures and transistor counts.

Of course, you will gain performance whether you're using the die shrink to run at higher clock speeds on a smaller die, or to add more transistors to end up with a die around the same size, but the scaling is not the same (especially when you're comparing different architectures), so it's not a perfect correlation.

Anandtech has an article on this (Early TSMC 5mn test chip yields 80%) which explains how TSMC gets these numbers, including information about the test chip which they use.

The percentage performance differences end up somewhat similar whether you base the calculation on die size or transistor count, because increasing the number of transistors (for a given architecture at a given clock frequency) also increases performance and power usage, but you'd get more accurate results if you used the numbers to mean what they actually mean, not something vaguely similar. You used a lazy method to calculate something that resembles the real value. You could argue that it works well enough for the purposes of this video, but it's not as reliable as doing the calculation properly.

To get more accurate numbers you should be comparing GPUs with (at least approximately) the same number of CUDA cores, TMUs and ROPs; not GPUs with the same die size, because power scaling with die size/transistor count is not linear. For example you could compare the GTX 980 to the GTX 1070 Max-Q - both have 2048 CUDA cores, 128 TMUs and 64 ROPs, and their clock speeds are relatively close, so manual adjustment wouldn't introduce a huge amount of error.

A Turing Stream Multiprocessor (SM) is made up of 4 partitions, each containing - among other things - 16 FP32 units (CUDA cores) and 16 INT32 units. Therefore a Turing SM contains 64 FP32-capable units, hence 64 CUDA/SM.

For the most part an Ampere SM has a similar arrangement. However, the INT32 units from Turing have been converted into INT32 / FP32 combo units. An Ampere SM contains 128 FP32-capable units, 64 of them dedicated to FP32, the other 64 are combo units.

Every clock cycle, the INT32 / FP32 combo data path of an Ampere partition can process either 16 INT32 ops *or* 16 FP32 ops. So while in a pure FP32 workload the combo units deliver the same amount of throughput as the dedicated FP32 units, in a more realistic workload the combo units are weaker - every clock cycle they spend processing INT32 ops is one they are not processing FP32 ops. This is why it appeared that Ampere‚Äôs per CUDA performance regressed from where Turing was.

The Ampere leaks assumed that Nvidia would market only the dedicated FP32 units as CUDA cores, and the CUDA core count would be calculated the same way as Turing, i.e. 64*SM count = CUDA count.
Instead Nvidia decided to count combo units as full CUDA cores, and Ampere cards‚Äô CUDA count became (64+64)*SM count = CUDA count.

Lastly though, when Ampere was rumoured to be what I thought was 5248 CUDA cores, it made no sense.

I remember commenting on a video that was what I thought, (although I used another Youtube channel then.) However maybe 7000 was not far off, as Ampere  CUDA cores do not equate to Turing Cuda cores.

It went to the RT cores. this is why beyond 1000 series we have to stop referencing, and start from scratch. series 3000 is probably referenceable to 2000 series but with an important part to notice: the 3000 series took the cache idea from RDNA2, and added this addition to the architecture. so here we will see some 4.5 billion transistors lost just for this capability alone (96MB L3 cache for 4090). important to remember those parts. I did (2 years ago) an academic article, explaining in deep, what RDNA2's new cache architecture is, both historically, technically, and mathematically, calculated with raw power figures ( I am a computer science and mathematics person) and I also explained why Nvidia will for sure add it to their next gen, and was correct.  3000 series incorporate a big L3 cache like RDNA2 .  If you want to read the article tell me, I will send it to you, or link it - its posted over the web. its in Hebrew (as I am Israeli) but google translate will do it in English for you. ** I can also explain it to you by voice talk (even better), if you want via whatsapp, or any other relevant tool for conversation. we can use zoom or MS-teams as well.

NGdu6v9jERc,@Gindi4711,2022-05-05T18:33:59Z,"Your math is giving me headaches.

Here is how it works (example N7 vs. N5):

TSMC gives these numbers:
-30% Power usage
OR
+15% Performance (clock speeds)
AND
1.6x density (1.8x for logic, 1.3x for SRAM, 1.2x for analog but lets say 1.6x to make it simple)

Lets say you have a chip in N7 with: 100FP32*1GHz = 100GFlop, 100W and 100mm¬≤

What this means is that by shrinking this chip you either get:
a) 100GFlop, 100-30% = 70W and 100/1.6=62.5mm¬≤
So same clock speeds, same performance, just a smaller chip that uses less energy.

Or you pump up clock speeds for same power consumption:
b) 100 FP32 * 1,15GHz = 115GFlop, 100W, 62.5mm¬≤

Note: This does not mean that N5 support 15% higher maximum clock speeds (for example Zen3 with single core boost of 5GHz), but only that you can get 15% somewhere in the middle of the frequency curve.

What GPU vendors usually do is use option a, but increase chip size to be at the same density again which linearly increases (theoretical) performance AND power consumption:
c) 1600*1GHz = 160GFlop, 70*1.6=112W, 100mm¬≤

Notice that the performance increase of 1.6x is a lot higher than the stated 1.15x (even if you reduce clocks to match 100W).


So lets do the calculation again focusing only on power consumption (assuming TSMC 10FF is equal to 10LPP):
8LPP vs. N7P = 0.66x (8LPP => 10LPP = 1.1x, 10FF vs. N7P is about 0.6x)
N7P vs. N5P = 0.7x
N5P vs. N4P = 0.9x

So in total 0.416x or 2.4x performance/W if at the same clockspeeds

From kopite7kimi we already know AD102 is 70-80B billion transistors. Subtract 4B for 86MB additional SRAM (L2) and we are down to 66B-76B. So lets say 71B. This is about 2.5x of GA102 which means 2.5x performance.

Let say a 3090 Ti is 450W and 1.1x performance over a 3090 (which was the reference for previous performance claims):
So this means 2.5 * 1.1 = 2.65x performance at 450 * 2.5/2.4 = 470W
If we go from 470W to 600W (1.28x) I think we can expect something like 10% higher clock speeds for 28% more power so 2.65 * 1.1 = 2.9x performance

Please keep in mind that this is a rough calculation not considering any architecture changes, different scaling behaviour of some GPU parts (IO and GDDR6x interface do not need to be scaled 2.5x, ROPs/TMUs not so much if the card is used at higher resolutions, on the other hand RT parts or L2 control logic might see more than 2.5x scaling etc.)",1,FALSE
NGdu6v9jERc,@MooresLawIsDead,2022-05-05T22:41:47Z,"You are falling into the same trap people who overhyped RDNA 2 fell into.  Navi 21 has 26.8 Million Transistors and Navi 10 has 10.3 Million Transistors.  Is Navi 21 2.6x the performance of Navi 10 bud?  NO.  In fact, the 6900 XT needs 33% more energy just to get to a 2.05x performance boost over the 5700 XT.  Even if you remove the space occupied by the Infinity Cache, it still doesn't make up for the fact that you need over 2.1x the transistors AND higher clocks to get to 2.05x performance.

RDNA 2 had higher clocks than RDNA 1, 2.6x the transistors, and a groundbreaking architecture...but it didn't perfectly scale with transistors like you claim is so easy.  Real life is not theoretical math - the world isn't perfect.

I'll keep going since this is funny to me, here's an Nvidia example: The Titan RTX has 18.6 Million Transistors (remember this is the ACTUAL full TU102 that is a full 11% stronger than the 2080 Ti), and the 450w 3090 Ti (actual full GA102 die) has 28.3 Million Transistors.  So that's a 52% increase in transistors for typically 43-50% more performance...and they had to increase power consumption by an incredible 60% to even achieve that!!!  Go ahead and compare the 2080 Ti to the 3090 if you bloody want to instead - in that case it's 46% more performance with a 40% increase in power consumption despite 52% more transistors in the full dies.

So let's now recap what you are claiming shall we?  You are now you're going to tell me, that Nvidia is going to somehow linearly scale performance with transistors while ""only"" increasing power by 33%?   If they do so, it's an incredible accomplishment, not something we should all just blindly accept that they can ""just do"".  They failed at it before despite having far superior node upgrades to work with in the past.",0,TRUE
NGdu6v9jERc,@Gindi4711,2022-05-06T21:39:12Z,"‚Äã@@MooresLawIsDead The whole discussion comes down to the question how ""3x performance"" is defined:
a) All the other leakers (and also me in my calculations) are talking about performance of the GPU
b) You are talking about gaming fps.

But gaming fps do not scale linearly with GPU performance. With the current gen using high end CPU + GPU fps scale about 75% with GPU performance so you have to increase GPU performance by 20% to get 15% more fps.

At lower resolutions scaling is even worse and it shifts more towards CPU and fixed delays. This will also happen with the next gen at Native 4K without RT.
My expection is that fps scaling on the next generation will be around 50-60% at Native 4K.

So the 2.9x performance in my calcuation will lead to 80% higher framerates.

Or in other words: Going from a 3090 to AD102 in 4K will be like going from a 3060 to a 3090 Ti in 1080p
At more GPU intensive setting like 8K or 4K + RT it will be higher.


For your examples:
5700XT vs. 6900XT:
This comparision is flawed because:
.) 6 billion (128MB*8Bits*6Transistor/Bit) transistors have been used on the 128MB of SRAM to compensate not scaling memory interface
.) TDP did not scale

AMD achieved 2x gaming fps (in 4K) which translates to around 2.5x GPU performance.
They did that 2x transistors (if you subtract the 128MB SRAM)
And they did that without increasing TDP 2x even when considering the 10% lower power consumption they got from going N7 => N7P
This was possible because there were still some serious issues in RDNA1 that seems to got at least partially solved in RDNA2

For Titan RTX vs. 3090:
.) 3090 got 1.7x GPU performance (1 Ampere SM equals 1.5 Turing SMs see 3070 vs. 2080 Ti caused by 64 active FP vs. 96 active FP with the other 32 doing INT)
.) TDP was scaled 1.25x so 1.36x reduction (which sounds reasonable going from a refined 16nm process to a refined 10nm process (sorry dont have exact numbers what it should be).
.) The 1.7x performance translate to 48% fps assuming 75% scaling again",1,TRUE

You have all this rationale, crumbled up and tossed aside for RDNA 3.  Stacking or chiplets, can really be beneficial in many ways for AMD but it is not magic. Monolithic chips are difficult because of yields, there is always a percentage of imperfections. This is why there are cut down chips, to make use of an imperfect chips.  A percentage of the chips are sold as cut down variants, it is not ideal but it mostly an issue of cost, capacity, how many full flat usable chips per wafer.  Chiplets are great for many reasons, they can help to get the most out of a to to wafer.  More chips per wafer, you should be able to buy/use less silicon and therefore  make more money.  Essentially, not having to so many cut down chips, or lower tier products made up from larger chips with wasted silicon that is fused off.
It is economic and sensible but not magical.

What amazes me in the current battle isn't the current or upcoming gens, but their sequel. With RDNA2 x Ampere, we had near performance equality. With RDNA3 x Lovelace, we will probably have AMD take the lead by a small margin, but Nvidia can still save the furniture by holding on to a few cards. Even if say only the 4060 or 4070 competes or is better than the 7600 or 7700, Nvidia will still not be too damaged.

But what after? Nvidia is already being cornered into making absurd power consumptions to even hold its ground. It's sacrificing good engineering (I.E knowing your limits/doing what's sensible) to keep at least a hand on the throne. RDNA 1 let Nvidia walk away laughing from a non-fight. RDNA 2 had them take things seriously. RDNA 3 is already forcing them to do absurdities just to keep their head above the water.

If RDNA4 brings in even just 50% performance increase, a year or so after RDNA3, what is Nvidia going to do? Pump out a 750W card? I'm seeing the walls shrink around them.

With Intel, AMD is at this point skinning an oversized, terribly managed hippo of a company. But Nvidia isn't Intel. They did not start hacking away at their own competence in the name of stocks or client deals. Nvidia took the place of richest company in tech from Intel precisely because it didn't stray from the product growth. They're not going to bumble around and just accept AMD to dice them like it's been doing to Intel. This competition is not going to simply be AMD ruling it all forever. The only question is, when will Nvidia be able to start doing the same effort AMD did? Switching from their old CPUs to Ryzen cost a lot of time and money. Vega to RDNA did the same. Now the dividends have started paying and they're gonna pay a lot more yet.

The first 4K 144hz monitors were announced in CES(January) of 2016....that is 6 years ago? And still the fastest/most demanding monitors on the market are 4K 144hz. Sure these things have dropped from 2000+ to like 1000 USD, but they also don't include the same specs as those first 4K 144hz like HDR 1000. So effectively, monitors haven't improved that much in terms of 4K panels. The only improvements we have gotten really are 240hz 1440P panels, by way of newer display port standards. 

There are 1440P 32:9 monitors(3000USD+  & plagued with QA problems), running 240hz...but that is still only slightly more than 4K 160hz. Most people are still on 1080P panels, and even in more enthusiast circles for PC hardware, most people are still running 1440P 144hz/1080 240hz. A 3070 is enough to run most games maxed at over 120 fps in 1440p(and even 4K in many titles) and most of the performance issues are due to poor optimization, which is a game dev problem. 

So I do think that going forward, lower end SKUs will probably be very popular but once the market saturates with these low end cards that out speed 3090s, I think GPU sales will stall out or even decline unless a lot more people get into the PC building scene. 

I do think that a small number of people will certainly still be getting the fastest cards but games already don't look a whole lot better going from medium/high to Ultra/RTX and GPUs are already getting a bit ridiculous in speed. I am not advocating for not getting that performance, I honestly want all the performance we can get. The problem also exists with CPUs to an extent. Everything that is a 8700K or better for Intel and a 5600X or better for AMD far exceeds the CPU use of any game at any existing resolution/refresh rate and those are the bottom of the barrel parts. Anything that is a 12700K/5900X or better probably will still be usable 7-8 years from now without any real loss in performance aside from being on DDR4 versus DDR5 or even DDR6 eventually.  This will come into full effect with mature DDR5 CPUs, where those things may legitimately end up seeing 10+ year use cycles as a somewhat common occurrence. 

We have the technology right now to make 4K 480hz monitors. DP 2.1 supports it and we are soon due for another iteration of display port which should increase it enough that 4K 480hz wouldn't even require the use of DSC to accomplish. At the very least, 4K 240hz should be a thing already. The only reason it appears to not yet exist is because many of the big monitor brands want to milk each and every bump in resolution/refresh rate as much as possible where charging 700-1000 USD for a monitor is becoming common place. This is going to stall out a lot of people from upgrading for a very long time, as it would mean replacing their entire system to run a new monitor and spending like 3000-4000+ to look at the same games in a slightly better image. Casuals are fine with 1440P 144hz(300 dollars) and competitive sweats are fine with 1080p TN 240hz(300) and both commonly go on sale, a small number of people upgraded to 1440p 240(problem with these is that 27 inches is too big for comp fps) and 4K 144.

People won't upgrade til its cheaper to do so, but for it to become cheaper, companies need not charge so much and they need more volume of sales. But neither are happening so prices remain high and adoption is low. 

Only way I see this being solved is when 1080P as a resolution is just completely done away with and that won't happen for another 10 years or more. All the FPS nerds(like me) are mostly fine with 25 inch 1080P panels that refresh as fast as possible, 360hz now(480hz and up tomorrow), and then all the panels that get down binned at a discount to 240hz or 144hz...people will just buy those. There needs to be 24-25 inch 1440p/4K panels at 240hz and up at competitive prices to get the adoption of higher resolutions up.",0,FALSE

Those 4K 144hz panels were demo'd and spoken of back 6-7 years ago in the same way we speak of these new panels now, and its taken the better part of a decade just for them to reach the market and they still aren't widely accessible. When there are at least 6 different brands of a spec of monitor, for under 500-600 dollars. That is when it is technically accessible. We are barely there with 4K 144hz panels, and they are like 250 nitt peak brightness with terrible response times for the pixels. This is what I was bringing up in the latter part of my intial post. People aren't buying these newer higher end monitors because they are way overpriced for what you are getting, especially considering their QA problems and performance, as funny as that sounds. 

For reference, 3440x1440p monitors at 100hz or more first were shown off around the end of 2016 for around 1400+ USD. By use of VA panels, which are dirt cheap. There have existed so so performance panels for around 500 or less since summer of 2020 and we are just now getting 144hz IPS versions for around 400-450. It is possible for adoption to be that fast, but we are unlikely to see it elsewhere as UW monitors have a niche carved out for them.

The juicy bit for me is RT. RT performance in the upcoming Gen of products is going to be interesting, especially if we consider newer AAA games will have some form of RT going on due consoles supporting the tech as well, which I think definitely nudges devs into using some lite forms of RT. So keeping that in mind, how good will AMD's RT capabilities be and will their roughly 20% raster advantage help them match up evenly with Nvidia when heavier RT is enabled?

As DLSS negates not only the need for high frequency (to a certain extent) it also reduces the need for large VRAM for textures. But, DLSS can only do so much as you still need to render everything else i.e. particles (frequency) and draw distance (VRAM size).

So the mobile rx7600m (assuming it shares the same specs as the rx7600xt) would also be around a rx6900xt desktop when clocked as close as possible to the rx7600xt desktop at 1080p. It will likely be slower than the rx6900xt at 1440p and definitely be slower than it at 4k. Meanwhile compared to the rtx 4060 mobile, the rx7600m would edge it out at 1080p, tie it in 1440p and get beaten by a bit at 4k.  

Nvidia's high end on mobile would likely have the rtx 4070 be a bit faster than a rtx 3090ti, and the rtx 4080 on laptops would be a scam as I doubt it'd be more than 20% faster than a 3090ti, while costing a arm and a leg. 

At the low end, nvidia's rtx 4050 mobile will likely perform like a desktop rtx 3060 and the rtx 4050ti might be a bit below a desktop rtx 3060ti. So powerful in their own right. Hopefully they can pull this off at 50-60w. But from the looks of it, they might need 80w.

NGdu6v9jERc,@joshdau,2022-05-05T02:29:15Z,"Doesn't this analysis completely ignore any performance gains from architectural improvement? What you've outlined here is a possible baseline improvement gen-to-gen if all NVIDIA did was copy and paste the Ampere design to a new node, and update the power and frequency curve to get the most out of it. It completely ignores any gains in performance that come from changes to the underlying architecture, like the addition of more ALUs, changes to those ALUs to improve throughput, or even more fundamental changes like we saw in the GCN to RDNA transition.

I agree that a 200% performance gain over Ampere is likely overhyping what's possible, however if - based on your analysis - NVIDIA could get double the performance of Ampere by simply shrinking the node, then it's not unexpected to think they could get 120-150% over Ampere by combining that with some architectural improvements.

For example, take RDNA1 vs RDNA2. Both of these were manufactured on the same node, yet were able to extract around 20% improvements from architectural changes alone (die size for die size).

EDIT: With all that said, I think the analysis here is misleading, which I go into more detail in on one of my replies under this comment. To be able to extrapolate performance like this, you'd need to isolate the performance gains made from node improvements in the previous generations compared, from the improvements from other changes, and that hasn't been done here.

It doesn't work like that, the previous generations improvements came from a combination of node and architectural changes, and any similarity between the gen-to-gen performance improvements and the claimed node improvements is coincidental at best, or a fudging of numbers to over exaggerate/overstate a correlation at worst.

Whilst I usually agree with almost everything MLID says, and I guess the ""heart"" in what he is trying to say here, in order to make the analysis that MLID is trying to make here you'd need to isolate the performance improvements in previous generations out from changes in architecture, compare that to the claims of the foundries, and then use that to extrapolate a rough guess at where this would take us in the next generation.",11,TRUE

He goes to quite extensive lengths to compare the generational improvements of previous GPU releases with the foundry performance improvements, making it out to be an almost one to one correlation. The foundry node performance improvement numbers come purely from their ability to clock higher at lower voltages - they don't factor in anything architecturally (architectural improvements come from the ability to include more logic in the same die area).

So to say that the Maxwell to Pascal improvements was roughly 60% and then show that the expected improvement based on the node numbers from the foundry should also be roughly 60% is disingenuous, it completely ignores the fact that there are architectural changes mixed in with the previous generations improvements.

A better analysis would have taken the Maxwell to Pascal gen-on-gen improvements, attempted to remove the % increase in performance due to architectural changes, and then compared the remaining % improvements with the foundry numbers, and THEN extrapolate what that means for the next generation.

If they go for a middling approach I expect at 600w 2.2-2.4x.

Generally I wouldn't use ""IPC"" to discuss GPU's but the layperson just conflates ""IPC gains"" with performance gains. When he talks about RASTERIZATION he's talking about typical, non-gaming, non-AI upscaling performance which is pretty much every game made before a few years ago and most games still today. There's a BALANCE to be struck between Rasterization, AI- upscaling and Ray-tracing. NVidia could have EASILY had way more ray-tracing hardware in the RTX ""20"" cards but then less transistors would have been available for typical game rendering... and AI-upscaling is great but it's not Universal. If NVidia gets AI upscaling working easily on OLDER games (similar to DLDSR) then it gets easier to justify a budget towards AI upscaling which in turn can free up performance to make ray-tracing work.
Anyway, you can talk about performance-per-Watt or whatever you want but it's basically ""IPC gains"" to the layman.

NGdu6v9jERc,@LiveType,2022-05-05T03:01:25Z,"Pulling out the hardware scheduler happened I believe with maxwell. It's what allowed for such massive efficiency gains at the expensive of greater cpu overhead which nvidia bet on not being an issue as cpus got more powerful. Cleary that didn't really happen so the hardware scheduler was put back in for turing due to the significantly more complex architecture. Turing should have been designed around ~2015 so the timeline makes sense. Not sure if that was the major reason it was put back in but it was definitely one of them. The overhead even now with the hybrid design is not insignificant as hardware unboxed showed. It is overall way better than AMD's though. That's undeniable. So what if you can hit high framerates if they aren't consistent? That's what a lot of congestion algorithms do. They trade a not insignificant amount of peak performance for improved consistency.

I can 100% see nvidia pulling it back out to claw back some efficiency and splitting their gpus lines up even more for more specialization for the sub $500 market.

proper DX12/vulkan games use completely different way of programming with async compute so software scheduler doesn't cut it anymore. that's my take anyway, it could be that scheduling can be done on CPUs once again since they're much faster than 10 years ago and nvidia can get away with decoupling the scheduler.",5,TRUE

In addition, by then electric cars will be significantly cheaper than ICE cars. I fully expect ICE to be here for a long time here in Africa, but in Europe it simply doesn't make sense as charging infrastructure becomes widespread.

So that's not a Talent, MAKING TIKTOK VIDEOS IS NOT A TALENT OK? Now,my point is that in Instagram, People Represent Their Lifestyle On Instagram in a Very Unique and creative Way And Theirs Lifestyles are also Amazing, They don't time waste in 15 second Videos, They work hard, they get results,they show it on Instagram.
