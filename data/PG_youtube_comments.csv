1. As far as I know 1st and 2nd year subjects have a weightage of only 10 percent.
So for these subjects I would not recommend watching lectures while you are in final year.
You can use First Aid or some other concise sources to brush up these subjects..
2. For final year subjects you can start watching lectures and making your notes (or annotating purchased notes)
A lot of 1st and 2nd year concepts are also key in understanding final year subjects so you would be brushing up those up as well with the final year subject prep..",1,TRUE

SrMAebpYTK4,@invertirdesdecasa,2022-12-14T22:32:41Z,"Hola Mauricio!
Yo diría que, si vas a invertir en renta variable (acciones), sea solo si tienes horizontes de muy largo plazo.
En dicho caso, si así fuere, te diría que lo mejor sería no tratar de medir al mercado. Es harto difícil y muchos inversores gastan millones en hacerlo, y aún así fallan.
Por último, el mercado no “sube cuando terminan de bajar las tasas”. El mercado, ante el más mínimo indicio de caída de tipos, probablemente reaccione al alza.

Sin embargo, repito: es imposible saberlo con certeza. Si no tienes horizonte de muchos años, lo mejor sería no tratar de jugar ese juego.

Es una opinión.
Soy asesor financiero y tengo matrícula profesional.
Pero te reitero: es un punto de vista, puedo estar equivocado.

SrMAebpYTK4,@Toia1975,2022-02-06T17:02:45Z,"Hola Arturo! Siendo sincera las finanzas no son lo mío, pero la mezcla del interes de aprender y un buen profesor hacen que esto sea cero aburrido, aunque cueste jaja. La verdad tus videos son geniales x la claridad con la que explicas (aunque reconozco que varios los tengo que volver a ver) y hacen que las empresas ""aburridas"" no lo sean tanto. Reconozco que el ambiente ""digital"" me es más afín (será que me tengo que volcar a los negocios tradicionales para aburrirme mas y, ergo, lograr mayores beneficios futuros?).  (chistes aparte) Debo decir también, que con este video se me empezaron a generar algunas dudas. Venimos hablando de la inversión a largo plazo, y de que si bien la bolsa tiene sus alzas y bajas (que no duran mas de 1 año como en el caso del 2001-dato resaltado en uno de tus videos) lo importante es comprar acciones de valor a un precio justo. Ahora, y tal vez porque no entiendo bien el concepto de ""acciones defensivas"", convendría pensar en acciones de menos crecimiento proyectado pero mas firmes en la tierra...esto es 1) porque crees que este mercado apretado va a durar mas tiempo del que creemos?, 2) porque es mejor tener diversificado el riesgo? 3) es por los que quieren tener también resultado a menos de 10 años? 4) porque no entendí nada?

SrMAebpYTK4,@invertirdesdecasa,2022-02-06T17:41:18Z,"Hola Victoria! Cómo estás?
En primer lugar, gracias por los buenos comentarios que siempre me dejas. Por otro lado, yo también suelo hacer (y soy amante de) los chistes (a veces no muy buenos), pero chistes al fin. Ahora bien, vamos a lo nuestro.

1) No recuerdo en qué video dije que las crisis pasan rápido, o que los mercados bajistas duran poco. De hecho, a veces toma varios años que una acción o mercado se recupere, por eso siempre trato de hablar de 10 años vista, preferiblemente. En el caso de este mercado, creo que veremos mucha mayor presión en las acciones (por un largo tiempo) porque la FED tiene que acomodar el desastre financiero que armó. En otras palabras: tiene que retirar la barbaridad de liquidez que inyectó a la economía, que está generando muchísima inflación. Eso no va a ser sin muchos temporales, puedes estar segura.
2) Respecto al riesgo: creo que estas empresas son jugadas ""defensivas"", no por su precio o menor fluctuación del precio. Sino que son jugadas defensivas (con bajo riesgo) desde una perspectiva económica de su negocio. Léase: no creo que haya disrupción alguna que haga desaparecer los detergentes para ropa o algunos medicamentos importantes. Una tecnológica, por ejemplo, si puede desaparecer de un momento a otro si otra empresa le gana la carrera hacia un avance tecnológico particular.  No creo que eso suceda con PG, por ejemplo. Ergo: hay menos riesgo económico empresarial.

Con esas dos respuestas, creo que ya te respondí varias de tus dudas. Dejame decirte que, aunque digas que no entiendes mucho, muchas de tus dudas hacen ver que tienes la mentalidad empresarial que hay que tener en las inversiones. Así que, vamos por el camino correcto.

Un saludo y que pases excelente Domingo!",0,TRUE
SrMAebpYTK4,@Toia1975,2022-02-07T00:06:47Z,"@@invertirdesdecasa  :) Con respecto al video me refería a uno donde hablas de como prevenir las crisis de la bolsa y donde después de analizar las caídas del SP500 (2001, burbuja inmobiliaria, etc) el indice siembre se recupera con mayor o menor tiempo (creo que la caída quemas tardó en recuperarse era la crisis del 2001 y fue un año). Justo la conclusion es...no pierdas el tiempo analizando las caídas de la bolsa si estas pensando al largo plazo y pagaste una valoración justa....porque siempre se termina recuperando. (Dato de color, si viste Billions, B. Axelrod (el protagonista) amasa su fortuna comprando acciones en el 2001). A esto le sumo ""Sé avaricioso cuando los demás sean temerosos..."" pienso que tiene sentido (entendiendo que el mercado va a estar jodido) verlo como una oportunidad + que como un riesgo para ponerse a la defensiva. Esperar esas empresas grandes cuando bajen su precio (FB, x ejemplo, y ojalá en algún momento google). A fin de cuenta...P&G tiene que promocionar sus productos...y alguien se los tiene que distribuir...y en 10 años me imagino un retail mucho más digital que personal (incluso mucho más que ahora).....eso no va a detenerse...y tiene mucho mas potencial de crecimiento. Siempre sentí que era tu mensaje...por eso me llamo mucho la atención pensar en modelos defensivos.

Claro, es totalmente cierto el concepto y está perfectamente claro. Ahora recuerdo el video del que hablas. Sin embargo, ese gráfico de las recuperaciones, mide el ascenso desde el piso de la caída (lo cuál es una aclaración importante).

Sin embargo, como bien decís (y el concepto no puede ser más acertado) hay que comprar empresas de calidad, a precio justo, con ventaja competitiva, que tengan excelentes rendimientos en su negocio y en su capital invertido. Con eso, básicamente te estás comprando una ""máquina de componer ganancias"" (como diría Buffett) y, en ese caso, el largo plazo es amigo de las excelentes empresas, más allá de las caídas o subidas de mercado.

Luego, siempre hay que tener algo de liquidez para aprovechar este tipo de ofertas: Alibaba, FB, JD, MRK, JNJ, todas ellas, son algunos ejemplos que aproveché con caídas fuertes, por ejemplo. Siempre es bueno ser paciente en la bolsa.

También sirven para analizar absolutamente todos los negocios cotizados en bolsa y comparar sus rentabilidades con sus competidores.

Te diría que, salvo el sector financiero (ahí es mejor el Retorno sobre el Equity) el ROIC es una medida universal para comparar las rentabilidades de las empresas, en tanto no operen muy apalancadas. Por eso, es mejor no utilizar el ROIC para el sector bancario (porque opera con mucha deuda).

SrMAebpYTK4,@invertirdesdecasa,2022-02-04T20:44:36Z,"Hola Julieta! Somo dos nerd por acá entonces jaja.
Que bueno lo que me decís! Eso es lo que más me interesa. Transmitir ideas y conceptos, más que mis propias decisiones de inversión. Me alegro que lo estés aplicando ahora vos también!

Un pequeño tip, ya que estamos entre nerds:
El ROIC, es decir, cuántos dólares del capital invertido se ""transforman"" año a año en beneficio para los inversores, te diría que es una de las métricas más importantes (salvando la industria financiera, porque operan muy apalancados... ahí es mejor utilizar el ROE -return on shareholders equity-).
Pero vuelvo: las empresas que tienen un buen ROIC, logran armar la bola de nieve para sus inversores. Pensalo así: si una empresa trabaja con un ROIC del 25%... año a año, va haciendo crecer tu capital (como inversora) a ese ritmo y, como una acción es una pequeña parte de una empresa, tu partecita crece a ese mismo ritmo también. Aclaro, nuevamente: esto se da en tanto y en cuanto la empresa no esté muy apalancada (no trabaje con mucha deuda... la deuda magnifica el ascenso... pero también las caídas).

Por otro lado: coincido plenamente con el análisis de JNJ. Ya lo dije en algún video: el pipeline de JNJ, sus ramas de negocios, lo hacen un negocio muy bien diversificado. En cartera también tengo MRK, porque tiene excelentes rendimientos (su droga Keytruda gana una fortuna, y tiene protección hasta el 2028 por su patente) y está más barata. Pero JNJ tiene un negocio mucho más diversificado, sólido y ""estable"" si se quiere.

También tengo posición en PG -ya hace una década- pero ni un centavo en JNJ y si bien coincido plenamente en la solidez de JNJ  tengo contradicciones pues es una industria básica ideal para estas épocas inflacionarias pero a 1/PER de 0,6 % año (perdón por mi repetitividad)...me cuesta entrar.

Muchísimas gracias por tu aporte Daniel. De tremenda calidad.
De hecho: hay un libro excelente que se llama ACCIONES ORDINARIAS, BENEFICIOS EXTRAORDINARIOS.
Su autor (P. Fisher) hacía precisamente esto que vos hiciste: hablaba con empleados, proveedores, clientes, etc, para saber si estaba frente a una directiva íntegra o no.

Por otro lado: es correcto. Confieso que simplifique el cálculo del ROIC. De hecho, el libro de Pat Dorsey (5 claves para invertir con éxito en acciones) lo explica mucho más completo y mejor.

Sin embargo, la idea es que siempre se entiendan los conceptos, por eso trato de simplificar. Pero, nuevamente, es cierto que no es del todo preciso el cálculo que propuse.

Muchas gracias por el comentario y te felicito (y aliento) por entrar en este mundo de las inversiones.

Respecto a los bonos: no soy experto en el tema (me dedico a la renta variable), pero yo particularmente no invertiría ahora en bonos. El aumento de tasas de interés (prevista por la FED) puede ser bastante malo para los bonos también. Te la hago tan simple como eso: TASAS y PRECIO de bonos se mueven en forma opuesta. 

Si las TASAS del mercado AUMENTAN (cosa anticipada y prevista por la FED), los PRECIOS de los bonos DISMINUYEN.
